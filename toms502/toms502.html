    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TOMS502</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      investigates the dependence of the solution X of a nonlinear system
      of equations F(X,ALPHA)=0 on the parameter ALPHA.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is an example of the use of the "continuation method".
      Under reasonable assumptions on the function F, the set of solutions
      (X,ALPHA) forms a curve, or perhaps a curve with bifurcations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If one point on the curve is known, or can be found, than further
      points can be determined by using simple curve-following ideas.
      One approach is to differentiate the equations with respect to ALPHA,
      and then apply an ODE solver.  However, this approach will fail if
      the curve has limit points with respect to ALPHA.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kubicek's approach is to work with a variable that approximates the
      arc-length of the curve, and to adapt this choice as necessary when
      the curve changes its direction.
