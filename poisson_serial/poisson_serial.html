      POISSON_SERIAL <br> The Poisson Equation in a 2D Rectangle
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>POISSON_SERIAL</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      computes an approximate solution to the Poisson equation in a 2D
      rectangular region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The version of Poisson's equation being solved here is
      <pre>
        - ( d/dx d/dx + d/dy d/dy ) U(x,y) = F(x,y)
      </pre>
      over the rectangle 0 <= X <= 1, 0 <= Y <= 1, with exact solution
      <pre>
        U(x,y) = sin ( pi * x * y )
      </pre>
      so that 
      <pre>
        F(x,y) = pi^2 * ( x^2 + y^2 ) * sin ( pi * x * y )
      </pre>
      and with Dirichlet boundary conditions along the lines x = 0, x = 1,
      y = 0 and y = 1.  (The boundary conditions will actually be zero in
      this case, but we write up the problem as though we didn't know that,
      which makes it easy to change the problem later.)
    </p>

    <p>
      We compute an approximate solution by discretizing the geometry,
      assuming that DX = DY, and approximating the Poisson operator by
      <pre>
        ( U(i-1,j) + U(i+1,j) + U(i,j-1) + U(i,j+1) - 4*U(i,j) ) / dx /dy
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Along with the boundary conditions at the boundary nodes, we have
      a linear system for U.  We can apply the Jacobi iteration to estimate
      the solution to the linear system.
