PROBLEM3:
  FORTRAN77 version
  A test problem for FD1D_HEAT_STEADY.
  Interior source term.
 
FD1D_HEAT_STEADY
  FORTRAN77 version
 
  Finite difference solution of
  the steady 1D heat equation
 
    - d/dx ( k(x) dUdx ) = F(x)
 
  for space interval A <= X <= B with boundary conditions
 
    U(A) = UA
    U(B) = UB
 
  A second order difference approximation is used.
 
  X data written to "problem3_x.txt".
  U data written to "problem3_u.txt".
 
PROBLEM3:
  Normal end of execution.
