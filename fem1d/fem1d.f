c
cc MAIN is the main program for FEM1D.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    The differential equation is:
c
c    - d/dx ( P(X) * dU(X)/dx ) + Q(X) * U(X) = F(X)
c
c    An approximate solution to this equation is determined
c    by the finite-element method using piecewise linear basis
c    functions.
c
c    Here U is an unknown scalar function of X defined on the
c    interval [XL,XR], and P, Q and F are given functions of X.
c
c    The values of U or U' at XL and XR are also specified.
c
c
c    The interval [XL,XR] is "meshed" with NSUB+1 points,
c
c    XN(0)=XL, XN(1)=XL+H, XN(2)=XL+2*H, ..., XN(NSUB)=XR.
c
c    This creates NSUB subintervals, with interval number 1
c    having endpoints XN(0) and XN(1), and so on up to interval
c    NSUB, which has endpoints XN(NSUB-1) and XN(NSUB).

c
c  Parameters:
c
c    double precision ADIAG(NU).
c    ADIAG(I) is the "diagonal" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  That is, ADIAG(I) is
c    the coefficient of the I-th unknown in the I-th equation.
c
c    double precision ALEFT(NU).
c    ALEFT(I) is the "left hand" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
c    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
c    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
c    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
c
c    double precision ARITE(NU).
c    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
c    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
c    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
c    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
c
c    double precision F(NSUB+1) or F(NU).
c    ASSEMB stores into F the right hand side of the linear
c    equations.
c    SOLVE replaces those values of F by the solution of the
c    linear equations.
c
c    double precision H(NSUB)
c    H(I) is the length of subinterval I.  This code uses
c    equal spacing for all the subintervals.

c    at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
c    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
c    and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
c    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
c    at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
c
c    INDX   integer INDX(0:NSUB).
c    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
c    associated with node I.
c    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
c    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
c    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
c    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
c    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
c    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
c    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node NSUB, which will be unknown NSUB or NSUB+1,
c    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
c
c    integer NL.
c    The number of basis functions used in a single
c    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
c    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
c    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
c
c    integer NODE(NL,NSUB).
c    For each subinterval I:
c    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
c    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
c
c    integer NQUAD.
c    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.

c
c    integer NSUB.
c    The number of subintervals into which the interval
c    [XL,XR] is broken.
c
c    integer NU.
c    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
c    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be NSUB-1,
c    NSUB, or NSUB+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
c    of basis functions.
c
c    double precision UL.
c    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
c    to have at X=XL.
c    If IBC is 2 or 4, UL is the value that U' is required
c    to have at X=XL.
c
c    double precision UR.
c    If IBC is 2 or 3, UR is the value that U is required
c    to have at X=XR.
c    If IBC is 1 or 4, UR is the value that U' is required
c    to have at X=XR.

c
c  Discussion:
c
c    The differential equation is:
c
c    - d/dx ( P(X) * dU(X)/dx ) + Q(X) * U(X) = F(X)
c
c    The linear system is
c
c      K * C = F
c
c    that is to be solved for the coefficients C.
c
c    Numerical integration is used to compute the entries of K
c    and F.
c
c    Note that a 1 point quadrature rule, which is sometimes used to
c    assemble the matrix and right hand side, is just barely accurate
c    enough for simple problems.  If you want better results, you
c    should use a quadrature rule that is more accurate.

c
c  Parameters:
c
c    Input/output, double precision ADIAG(NU), ALEFT(NU), ARITE(NU).

c    to compute the solution.
c    Note that for the first equation, there is no ALEFT
c    coefficient, and for the last, there is no ARITE.
c    So there is no need to store a value in ALEFT(1), nor
c    in ARITE(NU).
c
c    Input/output, double precision F(NU).
c    On input, F contains the right hand side of the linear
c    system to be solved.
c    On output, F contains the solution of the linear system.
