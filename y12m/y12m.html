      Y12M <br> A Direct Sparse Solver.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>Y12M</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      can factor and solve large sparse systems of linear equations,
      by Zahari Zlatev, Jerzy Wasniewski, Kjeld Schaumburg.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Y12M package solves linear systems A*x=b where the matrix A is stored in
      a sparse format.  Typically, most of the elements of A are zero, but this is
      not necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The matrix A may be completely general.  It does not have to be symmetric,
      positive definite, or have nonzero diagonal entries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost all the routines in Y12M come in a single and double precision
      version.  The two versions are distinguished by having a final letter
      that is "E" for the single precision and "F" for the double precision.
    </p>

    <p>
      Y12M includes one routine which solves a single system, Y12MAE.  This is
      probably the simplest routine to set up and use.
    </p>

    <p>
      If several systems must be solved, Y12M allows the user to solve them one at
      a time, by calling Y12MXE for the first system, and then Y12MDE for subsequent
      systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the matrix should be factored first, and only then should one or more
      systems be solved, this can be done by calling Y12MWE, followed by several
      calls to Y12MDE.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, for single precision linear systems, the user may solve a single
      system, and then apply iterative refinement, using Y12MFE.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sparse matrix format employed is extremely simple.  Three vectors
      are used which store, respectively, the nonzero entries of the matrix,
      and the row and column indices of those entries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gaussian elimination with pivoting is applied to the matrix.  The choice
      of pivot is influenced partly by an attempt to minimize fillin.  The
      three arrays which store the sparse matrix information must have a
      significant amount of extra space to store the fillin entries.
