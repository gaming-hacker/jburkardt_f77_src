    <p>
      <b>MXM_SERIAL</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 program which 
      sets up a dense matrix multiplication problem C = A * B.
    </p>

    <p>
      The matrices A and B are chosen so that C = (N+1) * I,
      where N is the order of A and B, and I is the identity matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MXM_SERIAL</b> is intended as a starting point for the implementation of a
      parallel version, using, for instance, OpenMP.
