QUAD_MPI
  FORTRAN77/MPI version
 
  Estimate the integral of a function F(X)
  defined over a multidimensional domain
  using a quadrature rule stored in 3 files.
 
  Use MPI to divide the computation among
  multiple processes.
 
 
  The parallel processing is carried out as follows,
  with process 0 playing the role of "master":
 
  Process 0:
 
  * Reads 3 files defining a quadrature rule.
  * Divides the quadrature rule into PROC_NUM
    portions, sending one portion to each processor
    (including itself).
  * Carries out its portion of the computation.
  * Collects and sums the contributions from
    other processes.
 
  Process I:
 
  * Receives one portion of the quadrature rule;
  * Carries out its portion of the computation.
  * Sends its contribution to process 0.
