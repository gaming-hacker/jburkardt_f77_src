    <p>
      <b>NETODE</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      computes the time-dependent behavior of a two phase compressible heated fluid
      in an abstract system of nodes and links.

      Examples and Tests:

    <p>
      <b>RUN00</b> has NETODE read some user input to set up an initial problem.
      Normally, this is done interactively,
      but it's possible to store the user input in a file first.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "run00_input.txt">run00_input.txt</a>,
          a text file of data that can be used to setup the two node problem.

        <li>
          <a href = "run00_output.txt">run00_output.txt</a>,
          the printed output from the program, which would go to the screen

        <li>
          <a href = "two_node_00.txt">two_node_00.txt</a>,
          the initial state of the two node problem, as created by NETODE
          in response to the user input.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>RUN01</b> has NETODE read the initial data in <i>two_node_00.txt</i>
