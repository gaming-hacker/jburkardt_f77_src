Dear John:
  I am a graduate student of Prof. Porsching, and currently working on
some network flow problems using NETODE. Many thanks for your help in 
recreating the program.

  Attached is the NETODE.F which works for the 2 test model problems appeared
in the EPRI report.

  NETODE.F now contains the following 3 parts:
  1. general description of the program;
  2. step by step instructions about running this program and sample
     input;
  3. source code.

  I used the LSODI available in the Math library here, and corrected some
  typo comparing with the original program.

  Answers to your questions:
  1. there is only one variable for VOID FRACTION, so there is no
     JALLIQ or KALLIQ;
  2. in subroutine EDINET, the change you made (RHLIQ = RHLIQ2) is 
     correct. It was an error.

  Thanks again for your help. Though I never met you personally, I knew you
  long ago through the work you did here. If you have any question about this
  program, please let me know.

  Regards,
    Xiaolin Wang
