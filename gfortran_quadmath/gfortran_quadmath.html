    <p>
      <b>GFORTRAN_QUADMATH</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      illustrates the use of quadruple real precision arithmetic
      with the Gnu GFORTRAN FORTRAN compiler.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every FORTRAN compiler offers a default real datatype as well as a double
      precision real data type.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Development of the FORTRAN77 language ceased on the release of the FORTRAN90
      standard.  However, some features of the newer versions of FORTRAN have
      "crept into" the older language and are accepted, at least by some compilers.
      Thus, the GFORTRAN compiler will allow FORTRAN77 code to declare single and
      double precision real variables with a syntax that mimics that it allows
      in FORTRAN90 code:
      <blockquote><b>
        REAL ( KIND = 4 ) W<br>
        REAL ( KIND = 8 ) X
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      On some systems, the GFORTRAN compiler also provides a real data type stored in
      80 bytes, specified by a KIND value of 10, and on some systems, a data type
      stored in 128 bytes, with a KIND of 128.  Variable declarations that GFORTRAN
      may accept would be
      <blockquote><b>
        REAL ( KIND = 10 ) Y<br>
        REAL ( KIND = 16 ) Z
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Macintosh OSX system I have access to seems to have the KIND = 10 option,
      but not the KIND = 16 option.
