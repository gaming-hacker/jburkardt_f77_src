      SETMAT <br> Generic Matrix Manipulation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SETMAT</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 program which 
      sets and gets entries of 
      a matrix stored in one of several formats.
    </p>

    <p>
      SETMAT tries to allow the user to ignore as much as
      possible the actual storage method used for the matrix,
      so that storage saving methods such as band, border-band,
      or compressed storage can be used, and interesting things
      like Gauss elimination, printing out the matrix, or computing
      a jacobian, can be done.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing to decide is the storage method to be used.
      The vector ISTORE contains some information about this,
      and in the compressed storage case, the array IA contains
      a great deal of information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall that a matrix stored in the LINPACK band format
      is given a lower and upper bandwidth, ML and MU.  Also,
      a border-banded matrix can be described as an N1 by N1
      square banded matrix A, a full N1 by N2 strip B, a full
      N2 by N1 strip C, and a full storage N2 by N2 matrix D.
    </p>

      Dense, full storage matrix:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Set ISTORE(1)=0, dimension IA(1,1) but ignore it otherwise.
    </p>
 
    <h3 align = "center">
      Banded, full storage matrix:
    </h3>

    <p>
      (all the zeroes are stored, but never referenced)
      set ISTORE(1)=1,
      ISTORE(2)=ML,
      ISTORE(3)=MU,
      set NROW.ge.NCOL.
      dimension IA(1,1) and ignore it otherwise.
      you can use the LINPACK routines sgefa/sgesl to solve
      linear systems.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Banded, LINPACK band storage matrix:
    </h3>

    <p>
      set ISTORE(1)=2,
      set ISTORE(2)=ML,
      set ISTORE(3)=MU,
      set NROW.ge.2*ML+MU+1
      dimension IA(1,1) but ignore it otherwise.
      you may call sgbfa/sgbsl to solve linear systems.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Banded, LSODI band storage matrix:
    </h3>

    <p>
      set ISTORE(1)=3
      set ISTORE(2)=ML
      set ISTORE(3)=MU
      set NROW.ge.ML+MU+1.
      dimension IA(1,1) but ignore it otherwise.
      Note that the only use for this format is when a user
      jacobian routine is called by LSODI.  In such a case,
      LSODI passes the values of ML, MU, and NROW.  Rather
      than try to add entries to the matrix yourself, you
      can call ADDMAT to do it for you, and avoid the messy
      calculation of indices.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Border-banded matrix:
    </h3>

    <p>
      For a border banded matrix,
      set ISTORE(1)=4,
      set ISTORE(2)=ML (lower band for matrix a)
      set ISTORE(3)=MU (upper band for matrix a)
      set ISTORE(4)=N1 (order of matrix a)
      set ISTORE(5)=N2 (order of matrix d)
      set NROW=1.  it is your responsibility to set aside
      enough storage for the matrix A, namely, at least
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1 + 2*N1*N2 + N2*N2.
      dimension IA(1,1) but ignore it otherwise.
      you can use the routines in bormat (sbbfa/sbbsl) to solve
      linear systems involving this matrix.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Compressed storage matrix:
    </h3>

    <p>
      for a compressed storage matrix,
      set ISTORE(1)=5,
      set NROW as the row dimension of the array IA, as declared
      in the routine where values are put into IA.  that is,
      normally, set NROW to the first dimension of IA.  of course,
      NROW must be at least large enough to store all the nonzero
      entries in any row.
      set the array IA(NROW,NCOL), where for a fixed equation J,
      IA(I,J)=0 except that every column K in which a nonzero
      occurs should be an entry of IA.  Thus, if equation 4 has
      nonzero entries in A(1,4), A(17,4) and A(33,4), set
      IA(1,4)=1, IA(2,4)=17, IA(3,4)=33 and IA(*,4) to 0 for any
      entries greater than the third.
      Normally, this mode could only be used with a Gauss-Seidel
      or Jacobi routine for solving linear systems, but care
      must be taken to insure that the matrix is suitable for
      such an iteration.  For example, a positive definite
      symmetric matrix would be acceptable.
