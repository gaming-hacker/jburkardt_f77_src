      LAPACK_S <br> Examples of Single Precision Real LAPACK Problems
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LAPACK_S</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 library which 
      can solve linear systems and compute eigevalues.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LAPACK_S</b> represents a subset of the full <b>LAPACK</b> library
      for single precision real arithmetic.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LAPACK</b> replaces the 
      <a href = "../../f77_src/linpack/linpack.html">LINPACK</a> and 
      <a href = "../../f77_src/eispack/eispack.html">EISPACK</a> libraries. 
      The <b>LAPACK</b> library is more flexible, has newer algorithms,
      and can often run much more efficiently than the older libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it should be noted that, internally, the library is
      quite complex.  When a user calls a single LAPACK routine,
      that routine may, in turn, potentially call 30 or more subroutines;
      trying to understand the logic of the algorithm, or even
      simply collecting all the routines involved in a single call,
      can be a painful task.  If I was trying to get an understanding
      of how to implement the QR or SVD algorithm, for instance,
      I would much prefer to read the LINPACK source code rather
      than the LAPACK source code!  Similarly, it is much easier to
      convert the LINPACK source code to the C language, rather
      than the LAPACK source code, simply because the coding is
      simpler, more straightforward, and does not involve such an
      elaborate nesting of subroutines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many vendors supply a compiled copy of LAPACK, optimized for
      their hardware, and easily available as a library.
      <ul>
        <li>
          On Apple systems running OSX, a compiled copy of LAPACK is available
          by adding the clause "-framework vecLib" to your link/load statement:
          <pre>
            gfortran myprog.f -framework vecLib
          </pre>
         </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p> 
      <b>LAPACK</b> includes routines to
      <ul>
        <li>
          Solve a linear system;
        </li>
        <li>
          Solve an under- or over-determined linear system;
        </li>
        <li>
          Compute the determinant;
        </li>
        <li>
          Compute the inverse matrix;
        </li>
        <li>
          Compute the condition number;
        </li>
        <li>
          Compute the singular value decomposition;
        </li>
        <li>
          Compute the QR decomposition;
        </li>
        <li>
          Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix;
        </li>
      </ul>
