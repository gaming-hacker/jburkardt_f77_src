      PRIME_OPENMP <br> Count Primes Using OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PRIME_OPENMP</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      counts the number of primes between 1 and N,
      using OpenMP to carry out the calculation in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithm is completely naive.  For each integer I, it simply checks
      whether any smaller J evenly divides it.  The total amount of work
      for a given N is thus roughly proportional to 1/2*N^2.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is mainly a starting point for investigations into
      parallelization.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are the counts of the number of primes for some selected values of N:
      <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr>
          <th>N</th><th>Pi(N), Number of Primes</th>
        </tr>

<tr><td>         2</td><td>         1</td></tr>
<tr><td>         4 </td><td>        2</td></tr>

      The following results were observed for the elapsed time on a machine
      that had 2 cores:
