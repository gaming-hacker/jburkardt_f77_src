c
cc MAIN is the main program for FEM1D_ADAPTIVE.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    FEM1D_ADAPTIVE solves the one dimensional problem:
c
c    - d/dX (P dU/dX) + Q U = F
c
c    by the finite-element method using piecewise linear basis
c    functions.
c
c    An adaptive method is used to try to reduce the maximum
c    error by refining the mesh in certain places.
c
c    Here U is an unknown scalar function of X defined on the
c    interval [XL,XR], and P, Q and F are given functions of X.
c
c    The values of U at XL and XR are also specified.
c
c
c    The interval [XL,XR] is "meshed" with N+1 points,
c
c    XN(0) = XL, XN(1) = XL+H, XN(2) = XL+2*H, ..., XN(N) = XR.
c
c    This creates N subintervals, with interval number 1
c    having endpoints XN(0) and XN(1), and so on up to interval
c    N, which has endpoints XN(N-1) and XN(N).
c
c
c    The algorithm employed by ADAPT tries to guarantee a certain amount
c    of accuracy by examining the current solution, estimating the error
c    in each subinterval, and, if necessary, subdividing one or more
c    subintervals and repeating the calculation.
c
c    We can think of the adaptive part of the algorithm as a refined
c    problem.  The program re-solves the problem on the pair of
c    intervals J and J+1, which extend from node J-1 to node J+1.
c    The values of U that were just computed at nodes J-1 and J+1
c    will be used as the boundary values for this refined problem.
c    The intervals J and J+1 will each be evenly divided into NY
c    smaller subintervals.  This boundary value problem is solved,
c    and the derivatives of the original and refined solutions are
c    then compared to get an estimate of the error.

c
c  Parameters:
c
c    double precision ADIAG(NU).
c    ADIAG(I) is the "diagonal" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  That is, ADIAG(I) is
c    the coefficient of the I-th unknown in the I-th equation.
c
c    double precision ALEFT(NU).
c    ALEFT(I) is the "left hand" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
c    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
c    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
c    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
c
c    double precision ARITE(NU).
c    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
c    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
c    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
c    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
c
c    double precision ETA(N).
c    ETA(I) is the error estimate for interval I.  It is computed
c    as the sum of two quantities, one associated with the left
c    and one with the right node of the interval.
c
c    double precision F(NU).
c    ASSEMBLE stores into F the right hand side of the linear
c    equations.
c    SOLVE replaces those values of F by the solution of the
c    linear equations.
c

c    FY is the right hand side of the linear system of the refined
c    problem.
c
c    double precision H(N)
c    H(I) is the length of subinterval I.  This code uses
c    equal spacing for all the subintervals.
c
c    double precision HY(M).
c    HY(I) is the length of subinterval I in the refined problem.
c
c    integer IBC.
c    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.
c    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
c       at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
c    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
c       at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
c    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
c       and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
c    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
c       at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
c
c    integer IBCY.
c    IBCY declares the boundary conditions for the refined problem
c    which should always be that the value of U is specified at
c    both the left and right endpoints.  This corresponds to a
c    value of IBCY = 3.
c
c    integer INDX(0:N).
c    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
c    associated with node I.
c    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
c    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
c    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
c    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
c    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
c    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
c    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
c    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
c
c    integer INDY(0:M).
c    INDY(I) records the index of the unknown associated with
c    node I for the refined problem.
c
c    integer JADD(N).
c    JADD(I) is 1 if the error estimates show that interval I
c    should be subdivided.
c
c    integer KOUNT, the number of adaptive steps that have been taken.
c
c    integer M.
c    M is the number of subintervals used in the refined problem.
c    M is equal to NY for computations centered at node 0 or node N,
c    and otherwise, M is equal to 2*NY.

c    integer N.
c    The number of subintervals into which the interval
c    [XL,XR] is broken.
c
c    integer NL.
c    The number of basis functions used in a single
c    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials

c    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
c
c    integer NMAX, the maximum number of unknowns that can be handled.
c
c    integer NODE(NL,N).
c    For each subinterval I:
c    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
c    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
c
c    integer NODEY(NL,M).
c    NODEY performs the same function for the refined problem that
c    NODE performs for the full problem, recording the node numbers
c    associated with a particular subinterval.
c
c    integer NQUAD
c    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
c
c    integer NU.
c    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.

c  Parameters:
c
c    Output, double precision H(N)
c    H(I) is the length of subinterval I.  This code uses
c    equal spacing for all the subintervals.
c
c    Input, integer IBC.
c    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.
c    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
c       at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
c    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
c       at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
c    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
c       and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
c    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
c       at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
c
c    Output, integer INDX(0:N).
c    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
c    associated with node I.
c    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
c    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
c    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
c    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
c    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
c    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
c    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
c    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
c
c    Input, integer N.
c    The number of subintervals into which the interval
c    [XL,XR] is broken.
c
c    Input, integer NL.
c    The number of basis functions used in a single
c    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
c    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
c    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
c
c    Input, integer NMAX, the maximum number of unknowns that can be handled.
c
c    Output, integer NODE(NL,N).
c    For each subinterval I:
c    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
c    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
c
c    Input, integer NQUAD
c    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
c
c    Output, integer NU.
c    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
c    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
c    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
c    of basis functions.
c
c    Output, double precision WQUAD(NQUAD).
c    WQUAD(I) is the weight associated with the I-th point
c    of an NQUAD point Gaussian quadrature rule.
c
c    Input, double precision XN(0:N).
c    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(0) is XL,

cc SOLVEY computes error estimators for a computed solution.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    SOLVEY accepts information about the solution of a finite element
c    problem on a grid of nodes with coordinates XN.  It then starts
c    at node 0, and for each node, computes two "error estimators",
c    one for the left, and one for the right interval associated with the
c    node.  These estimators are found by solving a finite element problem
c    over the two intervals, using the known values of the original
c    solution as boundary data, and using a mesh that is "slightly"
c    refined over the original one.
c
c    The computations at the first and last nodes only involve
c    a single interval.

c  Parameters:
c
c    Output, double precision ETA(N).
c    ETA(I) is the error estimate for interval I.  It is computed
c    as the sum of two quantities, one associated with the left
c    and one with the right node of the interval.
c
c    Input, double precision F(NU).
c    ASSEMBLE stores into F the right hand side of the linear
c    equations.
c    SOLVE replaces those values of F by the solution of the
c    linear equations.
c
c    Input, double precision H(N)
c    H(I) is the length of subinterval I.  This code uses
c    equal spacing for all the subintervals.
c
c    Input, integer N.
c    The number of subintervals into which the interval
c    [XL,XR] is broken.
c
c    Input, integer NU.
c    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
c    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
c    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
c    of basis functions.
c
c    Input, double precision UL.
c    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
c    to have at X = XL.
c    If IBC is 2 or 4, UL is the value that U' is required
c    to have at X = XL.
c
c    Input, double precision UR.
c    If IBC is 2 or 3, UR is the value that U is required
c    to have at X = XR.
c    If IBC is 1 or 4, UR is the value that U' is required
c    to have at X = XR.
c
c    Input, double precision XN(0:N).
c    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(0) is XL,
