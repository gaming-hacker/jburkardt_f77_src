cc MAIN is the main program for FEM1D_NONLINEAR.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    FEM1D_NONLINEAR solves the nonlinear one dimensional boundary value
c    problem:
c
c      -d/dx (p(x) du/dx) + q(x)*u + u*u' = f(x)
c
c    by the finite-element method using piecewise linear basis
c    functions.
c
c    Here U is an unknown scalar function of X defined on the
c    interval [XL,XR], and P, Q and F are given functions of X.
c
c    The values of U or U' at XL and XR are also specified.
c
c    Sample problem #1:
c
c      u(x)  = x, 
c      p(x)  = 1, 
c      q(x)  = 0, 
c      f(x)  = x,
c      u(0)  = 0,
c      u'(1) = 1.
c
c      The code should solve this problem exactly.
c
c    Sample problem #2:
c
c      u(x)  = 2*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x))/pi, 
c      p(x)  = 1,
c      q(x)  = 0,
c      f(x)  = -0.5*pi*cos(0.5*pi*x) + 2*sin(0.5*pi*x)*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x)/pi
c      u(0)  = 0,
c      u'(1) = 1.

c
c  Parameters:
c
c    double precision ADIAG(NU).
c    ADIAG(I) is the "diagonal" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  That is, ADIAG(I) is
c    the coefficient of the I-th unknown in the I-th equation.
c
c    double precision ALEFT(NU).
c    ALEFT(I) is the "left hand" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
c    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
c    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
c    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
c
c    double precision ARITE(NU).
c    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
c    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
c    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
c    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
c
c    double precision F(N+1) or F(NU).
c    ASSEMB stores into F the right hand side of the linear
c    equations.
c    SOLVE replaces those values of F by the solution of the
c    linear equations.
c
c    double precision FOLD(N+1) or FOLD(NU).
c    FOLD contains the value of F from the previous iteration,
c    and is used in ASSEMB to add correction terms to the
c    matrix and right hand side.
c
c    double precision H(N)
c    H(I) is the length of subinterval I.  This code uses
c    equal spacing for all the subintervals.
c
c    integer IBC.
c    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.
c    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
c    at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
c    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
c    at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
c    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
c    and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
c    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
c    at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
c
c    integer IMAX.
c    The number of iterations to carry out.
c
c    integer INDX(0:N).
c    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
c    associated with node I.
c    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
c    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
c    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
c    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
c    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
c    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
c    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
c    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
c
c    integer NL.
c    The number of basis functions used in a single
c    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
c    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
c    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
c
c    integer NODE(NL,N).
c    For each subinterval I:
c    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
c    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
c
c    integer NPRINT.
c    The number of points at which the computed solution
c    should be printed out when compared to the exact
c    solution.
c
c    integer NQUAD.
c    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
c    This code uses NQUAD=1.
c
c    integer N.
c    The number of subintervals into which the interval
c    [XL,XR] is broken.
c
c    integer NU.
c    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
c    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
c    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
c    of basis functions.
c
c    integer PROBLEM, indicates which problem to be solved.
c    * 1, u = x, p=1, q=0, f=x, u(0)=0, u'(1)=1.
c    * 2, u = 2*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x))/pi, p=1, q=0,
c    f = -0.5*pi*cos(0.5*pi*x) + 2*sin(0.5*pi*x)*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x)/pi
c    u(0) = 0, u'(1)=1.
c
c    double precision UL.
c    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
c    to have at X=XL.
c    If IBC is 2 or 4, UL is the value that U' is required
c    to have at X=XL.
c
c    double precision UR.
c    If IBC is 2 or 3, UR is the value that U is required
c    to have at X=XR.
c    If IBC is 1 or 4, UR is the value that U' is required
c    to have at X=XR.
c
c    double precision XL.
c    XL is the left endpoint of the interval over which the
c    differential equation is being solved.
c
c    double precision XN(0:N).
c    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(0) is XL,
c    and XN(N) is XR.

c    double precision XQUAD(N)
c    XQUAD(I) is the location of the single quadrature point
c    in interval I.

cc ASSEMBLE_NEWTON assembles the Newton linear system.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    The linear system being solved here is for the Newton correction
c    to an approximate solution of a nonlinear system.
c
c    Thus, we suppose that we have a nonlinear function F(X),
c    and an approximate solution X0.  If we can suppose there is an
c    exact solution X* that is "nearby", and in fact close enough
c    that Taylor's theorem gives us a useful estimate, then we
c    may write:
c
c      F(X*) = F(X0) + F'(X0) * ( X* - X0 ) + Order ( X* - X0 )^2 
c
c    and by rearranging, we get the Newton system (which is only
c    approximately correct):
c
c      F'(X0) * ( X* - X0 ) = - F(X0)
c
c    We solve this system and add the solution to X0 to get a
c    new approximate solution that, we hope, is much improved.

cc ASSEMBLE_PICARD assembles the Picard linear system.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    The equation we are trying to solve has the form:
c
c      -d/dx ( p(x) du/dx ) + q(x) * u + u * u' = f(x)
c
c    For the Picard iteration, we need to modify the nonlinear term u * u'
c    so that it is linear in the unknown u, and any other factors of u are
c    lagged.  One way to do this gives us the following equation:
c
c      -d/dx ( p(x) du/dx ) + q(x) * u + u * uold' = f(x)
c
c    where uold is the previous iterate.
c
c    Now we can formulate this system as a (linear) finite element problem
c
c      A * u = rhs
c
c    to be solved for the new approximate solution u.

c
c  Parameters:
c
c    Output, double precision ADIAG(NU).
c    ADIAG(I) is the "diagonal" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  That is, ADIAG(I) is
c    the coefficient of the I-th unknown in the I-th equation.
c
c    Output, double precision ALEFT(NU).
c    ALEFT(I) is the "left hand" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
c    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
c    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
c    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
c
c    Output, double precision ARITE(NU).
c    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
c    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
c    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
c    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
c    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
c
c    Output, double precision F(NU), the right hand side of the linear
c    equations.
c
c    Input, double precision FOLD(NU), the solution value 
c    from the previous iteration,
c
c    Input, double precision H(N), the length of the subintervals.  
c
c    Input, integer INDX(0:N).
c    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
c    associated with node I.
c    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
c    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
c    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
c    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
c    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
c    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
c    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
c    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
c    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
c
c    Input, integer N.
c    The number of subintervals into which the interval
c    [XL,XR] is broken.
c
c    Input, integer NL.
c    The number of basis functions used in a single
c    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
c    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
c    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
c
c    Input, integer NODE(NL,N).
c    For each subinterval I:
c    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
c    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
c
c    Input, integer NQUAD.
c    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
c    This code uses NQUAD = 1.
c
c    Input, integer NU.
c    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
c    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
c    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
c    of basis functions.
c
c    Input, integer PROBLEM, indicates which problem to be solved.
c    * 1, u = x, p=1, q=0, f=x, u(0)=0, u'(1)=1.
c    * 2, u = 2*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x))/pi, p=1, q=0,
c    f = -0.5*pi*cos(0.5*pi*x) + 2*sin(0.5*pi*x)*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x)/pi
c    u(0) = 0, u'(1)=1.
c
c    Input, double precision UL.
c    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
c    to have at X = XL.

c    to have at X = XL.
c
c    Input, double precision UR.
c    If IBC is 2 or 3, UR is the value that U is required
