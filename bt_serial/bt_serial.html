      BT_SERIAL <br> NAS Parallel Benchmark BT, Serial Version, FORTRAN77
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BT_SERIAL</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      is a serial implementation of the NAS Parallel Benchmark
      known as BT ("block tridiagonal solver for 3D PDE").
    </p>

    <p>
      The NAS Parallel Benchmarks are "paper and pencil" specifications; that is, the
      proposers have laid down what the programs must do algorithmically,
      but only very general rules about computer language implementation
      have been given.  Thus, a user or vendor has enormous freedom in
      implementing the benchmark program in a way that is optimal for
      a given architecture or parallel programming scheme.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a starting point for implementors, the proposers have supplied
      certain initial versions of the benchmark programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      This directory contains material derived from one such initial
      benchmark code.  Persons interested in the original source of the
      benchmark codes should NOT work from this material, but should
      go to the NAS Parallel Benchmark website directly!
    </p>

    <p>
      The benchmark programs are available in SERIAL, MPI and OPEN_MP
      versions, and in a sequence of "classes" of increasing size: S, W, A, B, C, D and E.
    </p>

    <p>
      Statistics for classes S, A, and B, are available, as run on one processor
      of a Cray Y-MP, with a FORTRAN77 version of the program.
      <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr><th>Class</th><th>Size</th><th>Memory (Mw)</th><th>Time (sec)</th><th>MFLOPS</th></tr>
        <tr><td>S</td><td>12x12x12</td><td>0.3</td><td>7.2</td><td>34</td></tr>
        <tr><td>A</td><td>64x64x64</td><td>24.0</td><td>923.0</td><td>192</td></tr>
        <tr><td>B</td><td>102x102x102</td><td>96.0</td><td>3554.0</td><td>203</td></tr>
        <tr><td>C</td><td>162x162x162</td><td>?</td><td>?</td><td>?</td></tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      Statistics for classes S, W, A, B, and C are available, as run on an Apple PowerPC G5,
      using this SERIAL FORTRAN77 version of the program:
      <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr><th>Class</th><th>Size</th><th>Memory (Mw)</th><th>Time (sec)</th><th>MFLOPS</th></tr>
        <tr><td>S</td><td>12x12x12</td><td>0.3</td><td>1</td><td>234</td></tr>
        <tr><td>W</td><td>24x24x24</td><td>?</td><td>32</td><td>236</td></tr>
        <tr><td>A</td><td>64x64x64</td><td>24.0</td><td>739</td><td>227</td></tr>
        <tr><td>B</td><td>102x102x102</td><td>96.0</td><td>3153</td><td>222</td></tr>
        <tr><td>C</td><td>162x162x162</td><td>?</td><td>45222</td><td>63</td></tr>
      </table>
      <i>The poor results for class C occurred because the program was run interactively
      overnight, and the computer "went to sleep" for 8 hours!</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      This directory contains the serial version of the benchmark, along
      with include files that allow it to run in some of the smaller sizes.
