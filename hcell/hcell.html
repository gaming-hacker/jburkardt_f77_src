      HCELL <br> Fluid Flow in an H-shaped Region
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HCELL</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      solves the time-dependent Navier Stokes equations in a
      two-dimensional region called the "H Cell".
    </p>

    <p>
      As time increases, other flow parameters may be varied as well.
      For this code, the flow parameter that can vary is the magnitude
      of the inflow specified at the left boundary.
      The program stores the results of each timestep in a file.
      Each solution may be thought of as a "snapshot" of the gradual
      evolution of the flow field over time.
      In a typical run, 500 such files might be created.  One set of
      such data is stored as
      <a href = "../../datasets/tcell_flow/tcell_flow.html">
      the TCELL flow dataset</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A collection of snapshot files may be analyzed to seek a small
      underlying basis of fundamental flows.  This basis may be used
      to approximate the entire set, or indeed to generate a reduced basis
      program that can quickly and cheaply compute new flow solutions
      whose flow parameters vary in small ways from those of the original
      set.  Programs that can be used for such an analysis include
      <a href = "../../f_src/cvt_basis/cvt_basis.html">
      CVT_BASIS</a> and
      <a href = "../../f_src/pod_basis/pod_basis.html">
      POD_BASIS.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      The "H-Cell" region is an H-shaped region.

      There are six sets of inflow and outflow vents in the flow region.
      A basis flow profile is specified for each set of vents.  However,
      for each vent group <b>I</b>, there is also a multiplier </b>BETA(I)</b>
      which can be used to modulate the flow strength.  To perform
      parameter studies, it was decided to consider datasets, each of
      which contained seven different settings for all the <b>BETA</b>'s.
      (Thus, such a dataset contains 42 numbers.)  Datasets were generated
