    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FFTW</b> 
      is a directory of FORTRAN77 programs which
      demonstrate the use of the <b>FFTW</b> library,
      which was written by Matteo Frigo and Steven Johnson.
    </p>

    <p>
      FFTW is a library of C routines which can compute
      the Fast Fourier transform very efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      FFTW can compute the discrete Fourier transform of:
      <ul>
        <li>
          complex data;
        </li>
        <li>
          real data;
        </li>
        <li> 
          even-symmetric real data (cosine transform);
        </li>
        <li>
          odd-symmetric real data (sine transform);
        </li>
      </ul>
      FFTW can also compute the discrete Hartley 
      transform of real data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The length of the data is not required to be a power of
      2.  Any length of data can be processed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data is not restricted to 1 dimensional vectors.  <b>FFTW</b>
      can handle data that is 2 or 3 dimensional.  In fact, the program
      can handle data with any dimensionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The FORTRAN77 include file is in /usr/local/include.  A sample
      copy is also available in this directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interested users should go to the FFTW home page:
      <a href = "http://www.fftw.org/">
                 http://www.fftw.org/</a>
      which contains the current source code, examples, and documentation.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Any program, subroutine or function that calls the FFTW functions must
      include, in its declarations, the statement
      <pre><code>
        include "fftw3.f"
      </code></pre>
      which will add the appropriate declarations for the FFTW functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      At link time, you must include the compiled FFTW library, which
      is probably a file with the name <b>libfftw.a</b>.  
      If <b>directory</b> is the directory where this library is stored,
      then an appropriate command might be
      <pre><code>
        gfortran myprog.f -L<b>directory</b> -lfftw
      </code></pre>
    </p>
