QUAD_OPEN_MP
  FORTRAN77/OpenMP version
 
  Estimate the integral of a function F(X)
  defined over a multidimensional domain
  using a quadrature rule stored in 3 files.
 
  Use OpenMP to compute the weighted sum in a parallel loop.
 
  The number of processors available:
  OMP_GET_NUM_PROCS () =        2
  The number of threads is        4
 
QUAD_OPEN_MP: User input:
