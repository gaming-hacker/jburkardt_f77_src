      CLAWPACK <br> Wave Propagation Approach to Hyperbolic PDE's
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CLAWPACK</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which 
      applies a wave propagation approach to hyperbolic
      partial differential equations in 1, 2 or 3 spatial dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      A beginning user should start by looking at examples 1 and 2,
      which are for 1D problems.  These examples use a routine called
      <b>CLAW1EZ</b>.  To use <b>CLAW1EZ</b>, the user writes a simple
      main program and three subroutines, and supplies an input data
      file.  To learn a little more about <b>CLAW1EZ</b>, look at the
      text of the routine that is included in the <b>CLAWPACK</b> 
      source code.
    </p>

    <p>
      For 2D and 3D problems, there are similar routines called
      <b>CLAW2EZ</b> and <b>CLAW3EZ</b> which are the best way to
      start working on problems in those dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have become comfortable with the way <b>CLAWPACK</b>
      works, and you want to have more control over how the problems
      are solved, you can go to the more advanced interfaces,
      which involve the routines named <b>CLAW1</b>, <b>CLAW2</b> and
      <b>CLAW3</b>.
