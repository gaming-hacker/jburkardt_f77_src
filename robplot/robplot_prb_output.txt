 HELLO!
  
   RobPlot
  
   Revised on 16 May 1997
  
   An interactive program which:
   * Reads a data file;
   * Accepts plot parameters;
   * Creates a PostScript plot.
  
   Latest improvements:
  
   * XMINR= and XMAXR= added.
   * X=, Y= handle name or index.
   * Axis limits are rounded off.
   * IPLOT= ...accepts a range of data.
   * Any data Y(I) can be plotted versus I.
   * ECHO command allows input files to be echoed.
   * Data is clipped to fit within plot box.
   * Input comments allowed, beginning with "#".
   * Data curve thickened.
  
 For a little help, type "H";
 For lots of help, type "HELP".
