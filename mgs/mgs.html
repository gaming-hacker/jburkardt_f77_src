      MGS <br> A Problem of Legacy Code
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MGS</b> is a FORTRAN77 library which
      is intended to embody the problem of "legacy code", that
      is, software that is useful, but out of date, not documented, not
      well understood, and in need of some new features.
    </p>

    <p>
      When approaching legacy software, it's useful to try to come up
      with good documentation for what the program is doing, a set of
      test problems which must be correctly handled by any new version
      of the software, and a set of timing problems that can show
      whether changes to the software have improved its efficiency.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this case, the student is challenged to make a copy of the source
      code, read it, try to work out what it is doing, document it, and come
      up with a nice set of examples illustrating what is going on.  A student
      might also be interested in the task of creating an equivalent version
      in a different language, and then demonstrating that the two programs
      produce the same results.
