Fortran runtime error: Array reference out of bounds for array 'a', upper bound of dimension 1 exceeded (11 > 10)
 
BOUNDS:
  FORTRAN77 version.
 
  This program uses an illegal memory reference.
  In this case, an array element A(11) is read,
  although the array is only dimensioned for size 10.
 
  Compilation with the GFORTRAN switch -fbounds-check
  will generate a run-time warning.
