      MINPACK <br> Least Squares Minimization
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MINPACK</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      solves systems of nonlinear equations, or carries out the
      least squares minimization of the residual of a set of linear or 
      nonlinear equations,
      by Jorge More, Danny Sorenson, Burton Garbow, Kenneth Hillstrom.
    </p>

    <p>
      MINPACK includes software for solving nonlinear equations and
      nonlinear least squares problems.  Five algorithmic paths each include
      a core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  The algorithms proceed
      either from an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or
      directly from the problem functions.  The paths include facilities for
      systems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares
      problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency
      of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a set of N nonlinear equations in N unknowns, F(X) = 0,
      Powell's method is used to seek a solution X.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a set of M nonlinear functions in N unknowns, F(X),
      the Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to seek an X which minimizes
      the L2 norm of the residual ||F(X)||.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user supplies a subroutine to evaluate the nonlinear function;
      the jacobian matrix dFi(X)/dXj may also be supplied by the user
      in a subroutine, or approximated by finite differences.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original FORTRAN77 version of MINPACK is available
      through <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/">the NETLIB web site</a>.
