  MAXL01 solves linear programming problems
  that involve variables restricted to the
  values 0 and 1.

 Solving problem 1 .....
 M=           6   N=           6
 RHS =            3           3          -9           7          -5           0
 entering maxl01
 MAXIMAL VALUE OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION =    15
 NUMBER OF MAXIMIZING POINTS =   1
    1 :  1  1  1  1  0  0
 ITERATIONS =        6   ACCELERATION TEST =     4

 Solving problem 2 .....
 M=           5   N=          10
 RHS =            5           5           1          12           2
 entering maxl01
 MAXIMAL VALUE OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION =    41
 NUMBER OF MAXIMIZING POINTS =   1
    1 :  1  0  1  1  0  1  1  0  0  1
 ITERATIONS =       11   ACCELERATION TEST =    10
