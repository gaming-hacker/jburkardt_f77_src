    <p>
      <b>ODEPACK</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      implements a variety of solvers for ordinary differential equations,
      by Alan Hindmarsh.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library includes routines commonly referred to as
      <ul>
        <li>
          LSODE solves nonstiff or stiff systems y' = f(y,t);
        </li>
        <li>
          LSODES is like LSODE, but in the stiff case the Jacobian matrix
          is assumed to be sparse, and treated with sparse routines;
        </li>
        <li>
          LSODA automatically switches between nonstiff and stiff solvers
          depending on the behavior of the problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          LSODAR is like LSODE, but includes the ability to detect and solve
          for solutions of a related set of algebraic equations;
        </li>
        <li>
          LSODPK is like LSODE, but uses preconditioned Krylov space
          iterative methods for the linear equation solvers;
        </li>
        <li>
          LSODKR includes the rootfinding ability of LSODA, and the
          Krylov solvers of LSODPK.
        </li>
        <li>
          LSODI solves the implicit system A(y,t)*y'(t) = g(y,t).
        </li>
        <li>
          LSOIBT is like LSODI, but assumes the matrix A is block tridiagonal.
        </li>
        <li>
          LSODIS is like LSODI, but assumes the matrix A is sparse.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      ODEPACK is a collection of Fortran solvers for the initial value
      problem for ordinary differential equation systems.  It consists of nine
      solvers, namely a basic solver called LSODE and eight variants of it --
      LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR, LSODPK, LSODKR, LSODI, LSOIBT, and LSODIS.
      The collection is suitable for both stiff and nonstiff systems.  It
      includes solvers for systems given in explicit form, dy/dt = f(t,y),
      and also solvers for systems given in linearly implicit form,
      A(t,y) dy/dt = g(t,y).  Two of the solvers use general sparse matrix
      solvers for the linear systems that arise.  Two others use iterative
      (preconditioned Krylov) methods instead of direct methods for these
      linear systems.  The most recent addition is LSODIS, which solves
      implicit problems with general sparse treatment of all matrices involved.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ODEPACK solvers are written in standard Fortran 77, with a few
      exceptions, and with minimal machine dependencies.  There are separate
      double and single precision versions of ODEPACK.  The actual solver
      names are those given above with a prefix of D- or S- for the double
      or single precision version, respectively, i.e. DLSODE/SLSODE, etc.
      Each solver consists of a main driver subroutine having the same name
      as the solver and some number of subordinate routines.  For each
      solver, there is also a demonstration program, which solves one or two
      simple problems in a somewhat self-checking manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, the ODEPACK solvers were upgraded to improve their
      portability in numerous ways.  Among the improvements are (a) renaming
      of routines and Common blocks to distinguish double and single
      precision versions, (b) use of generic intrinsic function names, (c)
      elimination of the Block Data subprogram, (d) use of a portable
      routine to set the unit roundoff, and (e) passing of quoted strings to
      the error message handler.  In addition, the prologue and internal
      comments were reformatted, and use mixed upper/lower case.  Numerous
      minor corrections and improvements were also made.
    </p>

    <p>
      The above upgrade operations were applied to LSODE earlier than they
      were to the rest of ODEPACK, and the two upgrades were done somewhat
      independently.  As a result, some differences will be apparent in the
      source files of LSODE and the other solvers -- primarily in the
      formatting of the comment line prologue of the main driver routine.
      In Subroutines DLSODE/SLSODE and their subordinate routines, the
      prologue was written in "SLATEC format", while for the other solvers a
      more relaxed style was used.  The differences are entirely cosmetic,
      however, and do not affect performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Documentation on the usage of each solver is provided in the
      initial block of comment lines in the source file, which (in most
      cases) includes a simple example.

      Solvers for explicit systems:
    </h3>

    <p>
      For each of the following solvers, it is assumed that the ODEs are
      given explicitly, so that the system can be written in the form
      dy/dt = f(t,y), where y is the vector of dependent variables, and t is
      the independent variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LSODE</b> (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations) is the
      basic solver of the collection.  It solves stiff and nonstiff systems
      of the form dy/dt = f.  In the stiff case, it treats the Jacobian
      matrix df/dy as either a dense (full) or a banded matrix, and as either
      user-supplied or internally approximated by difference quotients.
      It uses Adams methods (predictor-corrector) in the nonstiff case,
      and Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods (the Gear methods)
      in the stiff case.  The linear systems that arise are solved by direct
      methods (LU factor/solve).  LSODE supersedes the older GEAR and GEARB
      packages, and reflects a complete redesign of the user interface
      and internal organization, with some algorithmic improvements.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LSODES</b>, written jointly with A. H. Sherman, solves systems dy/dt = f
      and in the stiff case treats the Jacobian matrix in general sparse
      form.  It determines the sparsity structure on its own, or optionally
      accepts this information from the user.  It then uses parts of the
      Yale Sparse Matrix Package (YSMP) to solve the linear systems that
      arise, by a sparse (direct) LU factorization/backsolve method.
      LSODES supersedes, and improves upon, the older GEARS package.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LSODA</b>, written jointly with L. R. Petzold, solves systems dy/dt = f
      with a dense or banded Jacobian when the problem is stiff, but it
      automatically selects between nonstiff (Adams) and stiff (BDF)
      methods.  It uses the nonstiff method initially, and dynamically
      monitors data in order to decide which method to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LSODAR</b>, also written jointly with L. R. Petzold, is a variant of
      LSODA with a rootfinding capability added.  Thus it solves problems
      dy/dt = f with dense or banded Jacobian and automatic method
      selection, and at the same time, it finds the roots of any of a
      set of given functions of the form g(t,y).  This is often useful
      for finding stop conditions, or for finding points at which a switch
      is to be made in the function f.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LSODPK</b>, written jointly with Peter N. Brown, is a variant of LSODE
      in which the direct solvers for the linear systems have been replaced
      by a selection of four preconditioned Krylov (iterative) solvers.
      The user must supply a pair of routine to evaluate, preprocess, and
      solve the (left and/or right) preconditioner matrices.  LSODPK also
      includes an option for a user-supplied linear system solver to be used
      without Krylov iteration.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LSODKR</b> is a variant of LSODPK with the addition of the same
      rootfinding capability as in LSODAR, and also of automatic switching
      between functional and Newton iteration.  The nonlinear iteration
      method-switching differs from the method-switching in LSODA and LSODAR,
      but provides similar savings by using the cheaper method in the non-stiff
      regions of the problem.  LSODKR also improves on the Krylov methods in
      LSODPK by offering the option to save and reuse the approximate Jacobian
      data underlying the preconditioner.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Solvers for linearly implicit systems:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The following solvers treat systems in the linearly implicit form
      A(t,y) dy/dt = g(t,y), A = a square matrix, i.e. with the derivative
      dy/dt implicit, but linearly so.  These solvers allow A to be
      singular, in which case the system is a differential-algebraic
      equation (DAE) system.  In that case, the user must be very careful
      to supply a well-posed problem with consistent initial conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LSODI</b>, written jointly with J. F. Painter, solves linearly implicit
      systems in which the matrices involved (A, dg/dy, and d(A dy/dt)/dy)
      are all assumed to be either dense or banded.  LSODI supersedes the
      older GEARIB solver and improves upon it in numerous ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LSOIBT</b>, written jointly with C. S. Kenney, solves linearly implicit
      systems in which the matrices involved are all assumed to be
      block-tridiagonal.  Linear systems are solved by the LU method.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>LSODIS</b>, written jointly with S. Balsdon, solves linearly implicit
      systems in which the matrices involved are all assumed to be sparse.
      Like LSODES, LSODIS either determines the sparsity structure or
      accepts it from the user, and uses parts of the Yale Sparse Matrix
      Package to solve the linear systems that arise, by a direct method.
