#  Discussion:
#
#    This is an artificial example used to illustrate a paper.
#
#    Note that this "distance" matrix is NOT SYMMETRIC.
#    D(I,J) represents the cost of shipping to city I from city J,
#    and this need not equal D(J,I)!
#
#    A weight vector may be used to weight the costs by city
#    population, for instance.
#
#    The task was to locate sources within the cities, so as 
#    to MAXIMIZE the total of the distance from each city to its 
#    nearest source.  Note that if we are given two choices from
#    which to ship, we always choose the most expensive one!
#
#    Sources   Location   Total Distance

#    1         1          24
#    2         1 2        35
#    3         1 2 3      36
