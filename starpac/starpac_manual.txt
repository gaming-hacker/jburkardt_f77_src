 A.  Overview of STARPAC and Its Contents                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                        
      STARPAC is a portable library of approximately 150 user-callable ANSI  77                                                         
 Fortran  subroutines for  statistical data analysis.   Designed primarily  for                                                         
 time series analysis and for nonlinear least squares regression,  STARPAC also                                                         
 includes subroutines for normal random number generation, line  printer plots,                                                         
 basic statistical analyses and linear least squares.  Emphasis has been placed                                                         
 on facilitating  the  interpretation of  statistical analyses,  and,  for this                                                         
 reason,  comprehensive printed  reports of auxiliary  statistical information,                                                         
 often  in graphical  form,  are automatically  provided to  augment  the basic                                                         
 statistical  computations performed by each user-callable  STARPAC subroutine.                                                         
 STARPAC thus  provides  the  best  features of  many  stand-alone  statistical                                                         
 software programs within the flexible environment of a subroutine library.                                                             
                                                                                                                                        
      STARPAC is  designed to be easy to  use; in  many situations, only  a few                                                         
 lines of elementary Fortran code are required for the users' main programs.  A                                                         
 fundamental STARPAC  philosophy  is  to  provide  two  or  more  user-callable                                                         
 subroutines  for each method of analysis:   one which minimizes the complexity                                                         
 of the CALL statement, automatically producing a comprehensive  printed report                                                         
 of the  results; and  one or more  others which  provide user  control  of the                                                         
 computations, allow suppression of all or part of the printed  reports, and/or

      The documentation  for  the various  STARPAC subroutine  families  uses a                                                         
 standard  format description  of  the  information  needed to  use  a  STARPAC                                                         
 subroutine, including one or more examples.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                        
      References to chapter sections within the STARPAC documentation refer  to                                                         
 the  identified  section  within  the current chapter unless explicitly stated                                                         
 otherwise.  Figures are identified by the section in  which  they  occur.  For                                                         
 example,  figure  B-1  refers to the first figure in section B of this chapter

      Names of INTEGER  and REAL  STARPAC subroutine  arguments  are consistent                                                         
 with the implicit Fortran  convention for specifying variable type.   That is,                                                         
 variable  names beginning with I through  N are type INTEGER while  all others                                                         
 are type REAL unless  otherwise explicitly typed DOUBLE PRECISION  or COMPLEX.                                                         
 All dimensioned variables are explicitly declared in STARPAC  documentation by

1appropriate.   The  convention  used to  specify the  dimension  statements is                                                         
 discussed below in section D.2.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
      The precision of the STARPAC library is indicated in the printed  reports                                                         
 generated by STARPAC:  an S following the STARPAC version number in the output                                                         
 heading indicates the single precision  version  is  being  used,  while  a  D                                                         
 indicates the double precision version.  The STARPAC documentation is designed                                                         
 for  use with both single and double precision versions.  Subroutine arguments                                                         
 which are double precision in both versions  are  declared  DOUBLE  PRECISION;                                                         
 similarly,  arguments which are single precision in both versions are declared

 double  precision version of the STARPAC library is being used,  then the user                                                         
 should substitute DOUBLE PRECISION for <real>; if the single precision version                                                         
 is being used,  then  the  user  should  substitute  REAL  for  <real>.  Other                                                         
 precision-dependent features are discussed as they occur.

 STARPAC,  including a  discussion  of Fortran  programming as  it  relates  to                                                         
 STARPAC usage.   Although only elementary knowledge of Fortran is  required to                                                         
 use STARPAC, users may still have to consult with a Fortran text  and/or their                                                         
 Computing Center staff when questions arise.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
 D.1  The PROGRAM Statement                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                        
      The PROGRAM statement is used to name the user's main program.   The name                                                         
 EXAMPL is  assigned to the  main program  in this example.   The program  name                                                         
 cannot  be  the name  of any  variable  in the  user's main  program  and,  in                                                         
 addition, cannot be the name of any other subroutine or function called during                                                         
 execution of  the user's code.   Specifically, it  cannot be  the name of  any                                                         
 subroutine within STARPAC.  To ensure that the name of a STARPAC subroutine is                                                         
 not inadvertently  chosen for  the  name of  the main  program,  users  should                                                         
 consult with  the local installer of STARPAC  to obtain a list of  the STARPAC                                                         
 subroutine names.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
 D.2  The Dimension Statements                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                        
      The user's program must include dimension statements to define  the sizes                                                         
 and types of the  vectors, matrices  and three-dimensional arrays  required by                                                         
 each STARPAC subroutine used; STARPAC  itself has  no inherent upper  limit on                                                         
 problem size.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                        
      Within the STARPAC documentation for the subroutine declaration and  CALL                                                         
 statements,  lowercase  identifiers  in  the  dimension  statements  represent                                                         
 integer constants which must equal or exceed the  value  of  the  identically-                                                         
 spelled  uppercase argument.  For example,  if the documentation specifies the                                                         
 minimum dimension of a variable as  <real>  XM(n,m),  and  if  the  number  of                                                         
 observations N is 15, and the number of columns of data M is 3, then (assuming                                                         
 the  single precision version of STARPAC is being used) the minimum array size                                                         
 is given by the dimension statement REAL XM(15,3).                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        
      The  exact dimensions  assigned  to some  vectors and  matrices  must  be                                                         
 supplied in the CALL statements to some STARPAC subroutines.  For example, the                                                         
 argument IXM  is defined  as "the exact  value of  the first dimension  of the                                                         
 matrix XM as  declared in the calling program."   Continuing the  example from                                                         
 the preceding paragraph, if the  statement REAL XM(20,5) is used  to dimension                                                         
 the matrix XM for a particular subroutine, and IXM is an argument in  the CALL                                                         
 statement, then IXM must have the value 20 regardless of the value assigned to                                                         
 the variable N.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
      Many STARPAC subroutines  require a work area for  internal computations.                                                         
 This  work area is provided by  the DOUBLE PRECISION vector DSTAK.   The rules                                                         
 for defining DSTAK are as follows.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        
      1. Programs which call  subroutines requiring the work vector  DSTAK must                                                         
         include  the  statements                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                        
                        DOUBLE PRECISION DSTAK (ldstak)                                                                                 
                        COMMON /CSTAK/ DSTAK                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                        
         where ldstak indicates the integer constant used to dimension DSTAK.                                                           
                                                                                                                                        
                                     <1-7>                                                                                              
1                                                                                                                                       
      2. Since all STARPAC subroutines use the same work vector, the  length of                                                         
         DSTAK must equal or exceed the  longest length required by any  of the                                                         
         individual STARPAC subroutines called by the user's program.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                        
      3. The length, LDSTAK, of the work vector DSTAK must be specified  in the                                                         
         CALL statement of any STARPAC subroutine using DSTAK to enable STARPAC                                                         
         to verify that there will be sufficient work area for the problem.                                                             
                                                                                                                                        
      It is recommended that a variable LDSTAK  be set to the length  of DSTAK,                                                         
 and that this variable be used in each CALL statement requiring the  length of                                                         
 DSTAK to be specified.   Then, if a future modification to the  user's program                                                         
 requires the length of DSTAK to  be changed, the only alterations  required in                                                         
 the existing code would be to the DOUBLE PRECISION dimension statement  and to                                                         
 the statement which assigns the length of DSTAK to LDSTAK.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                        
      STARPAC  manages  its  work area using subroutines modeled after those in                                                         
 ACM Algorithm 528:  Framework for a  Portable  Library  [Fox  et  al.  1978a].                                                         
 Although STARPAC and the Framework share the same COMMON for their work areas,                                                         
 there  are differences between the STARPAC management subroutines and those of                                                         
 the  Framework.   In  particular,   the  STARPAC  management  subroutines  re-                                                         
 initialize  DSTAK  each  time  the user invokes a STARPAC subroutine requiring                                                         
 work area, destroying all data previously stored in DSTAK;  the Framework only                                                         
 initializes  DSTAK  the  first  time  any  of  its  management subroutines are                                                         
 invoked,  preserving work area allocations still in use.  Thus,  users must be                                                         
 cautious  when  utilizing  STARPAC  with  other  libraries  which  employ  the                                                         
 Framework, such as PORT [Fox et al., 1978b].                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                        
      The sample program shown in figure C-1 provides an example of the use  of                                                         
 dimensioned  variables  with  STARPAC.   The  REAL  vector  Y,  used  by  both                                                         
 subroutines PP and STAT,  contains the 84 relative humidity measurements;  its                                                         
 minimum length, N (the number of observations), is 84.  The REAL vector X used                                                         
 by  subroutine  PP  contains the corresponding time order indices of the data;                                                         
 its minimum length is also 84.  The DOUBLE PRECISION vector DSTAK contains the                                                         
 work area needed by STAT for intermediate computations; its minimum length, 49                                                         
 in this case,  is defined in section D of chapter  4.  In  this  example,  the

 values.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
 D.3  The CALL Statements                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                        
      The STARPAC CALL statement arguments provide the interface for specifying                                                         
 the data to be used, controlling the computations, and providing space for any                                                         
 returned results.   The CALL  statements used  in the example  (fig. C-1)  are                                                         
 CALL PP(Y, X, N) and CALL STAT(Y, N, LDSTAK).   Note that scalar arguments may                                                         
 be specified either by a variable preset to the desired value, as was  done in                                                         
 the  example,  or   by  the  actual  numerical  values.    For  example,  CALL                                                         
 PP(Y, X, 84)  and CALL STAT(Y, 84, 100)  could have  been used instead  of the                                                         
 forms shown.   We recommend  using variables rather than the  actual numerical                                                         
 values in order to simplify future changes in the program.  When variables are                                                         
 used, changes need to be made in only  one place; numerical values have  to be                                                         
 changed every  place they occur.   The use  of variables can also clarify  the                                                         
 meaning of the program.

1D.4  STARPAC Output                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                        
      Most STARPAC  subroutines produce extensive printed reports,  freeing the                                                         
 user from formatting and  printing all  statistics of interest.   The standard                                                         
 output device is used for these reports.   The user has the options of titling                                                         
 the reports and changing the output device.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                        
      The first page of the report from each STARPAC subroutine does  not start                                                         
 on a new page.  This allows the user to supply titles.  For example,

 will print the title DAVIS-HARRISON PIKES PEAK RELATIVE HUMIDITY DATA  on  the                                                         
 top line of a new page,  immediately preceding the output produced by the call                                                         
 to subroutine PP.   Users should note that titles more than one line in length                                                         
 can cause a  printed report  designed for one page to extend beyond the bottom                                                         
 of the page.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                        
      The unit number, IPRT, of the  output device used by STARPAC  is returned                                                         
 by STARPAC subroutine IPRINT.   Users can change the output device unit number                                                         
 by including with their program  a subroutine IPRINT which will  supersede the                                                         
 STARPAC subroutine of the same name.  The subroutine must have the form

 D.5  STARPAC Error Handling                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                        
      STARPAC  provides extensive error-checking facilities which  include both                                                         
 printed  reports and  a  program-accessible  error flag  variable.   There are                                                         
 essentially two types of errors STARPAC can detect.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                        
      The first type  of error involves incorrect problem  specification, i.e.,                                                         
 one or more of the input arguments in the subroutine statement has an improper                                                         
 value.   For example,  the number of observations, N,  might have an obviously                                                         
 meaningless non-positive value.  In the case of improper problem specification                                                         
 STARPAC generates a  printed report  identifying the subroutine  involved, the                                                         
 error  detected, and the proper form  of the  subroutine CALL statement.   The                                                         
 latter  is  provided  because  improper  input  is  often  the  result  of  an                                                         
 incorrectly specified subroutine argument list.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
      A second type of error can be thought of as a computation error:   either                                                         
 the initiated calculation cannot be  completed or the results from  the called                                                         
 subroutine are questionable.   For example,  when the least squares model  and                                                         
 data are found to be  singular, the desired computations cannot  be completed;                                                         
 when one or more of the standardized residuals from a least squares fit cannot                                                         
 be computed  because the  standard  deviation of  the residual  is  zero,  the                                                         
 results of  the error  estimates  from the  least squares  regression  may  be                                                         
 questionable.   If a computation error is detected, STARPAC generates a report                                                         
 which identifies the error, and, to aid  the user in determining the  cause of                                                         
                                                                                                                                        
                                     <1-9>                                                                                              
1the error, summarizes the completed results in a printed report.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                        
      STARPAC error reports cannot be suppressed,  even when the normal  output                                                         
 from  the  STARPAC  subroutine  has  been suppressed.  (STARPAC output must be                                                         
 directed to a separate output device [see section D.4] when users do not  want                                                         
 any STARPAC reports displayed under any conditions.) Because  of  this,  users                                                         
 seldom have to consciously handle STARPAC error conditions in their code.                                                              
                                                                                                                                        
      When proper execution of the user's program depends on knowing whether or                                                         
 not an error has been detected, the error flag can be examined from within the                                                         
 user's code.  When access to the error flag is desired, the statement

 Following the execution of a STARPAC subroutine, the variable IERR will be set

 value of IERR may indicate the type of error [e.g., see chapter 9,  section D,

 then the program will stop  when an  error is detected.   (In figure  C-1, the

      STARPAC error-checking procedures catch many programming errors and print                                                         
 informative diagnostics  when such  errors are detected.   However, there  are                                                         
 some  errors  which  STARPAC cannot  detect.   The  more  common of  these are                                                         
 discussed below.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                        
      1. The most common error  involves array dimensions which are  too small.                                                         
         Although certain arguments are checked by STARPAC to verify that array                                                         
         dimensions  are  adequate, if  incorrect information  is  supplied  to                                                         
         STARPAC, or if the dimension of an  array which is not checked  is too                                                         
         small, the program  will produce  erroneous results  and/or  will stop                                                         
         prematurely.   Users should  check the  dimension statements in  their                                                         
         program whenever difficulties are encountered in using STARPAC.                                                                
                                                                                                                                        
      2. The second most common error involves incorrect CALL  statements, that                                                         
         is,  CALL  statements   in  which  the  STARPAC  subroutine   name  is                                                         
         misspelled,  the  arguments  are  incorrectly  ordered,  one  or  more                                                         
         arguments are omitted,  or the  argument types (INTEGER,  REAL, DOUBLE                                                         
         PRECISION, and  COMPLEX) are incorrect.   Users having  problems using                                                         
         STARPAC should  carefully check their declaration and  CALL statements                                                         
         to verify that they agree with the documentation.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                        
      3. The third most  common error  involves incorrect specification  of the                                                         
         work vector DSTAK.   Programs which call STARPAC subroutines requiring                                                         
         work area must  include both the DOUBLE PRECISION  statement dimension                                                         
         DSTAK and the COMMON /CSTAK/ DSTAK statement.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                        
      4. The final  common error involves user-supplied subroutines  which have                                                         
         the same name as a  subroutine in  the STARPAC library.   Users should

         STARPAC subroutine names.  This list can then be used to ensure that a                                                         
         STARPAC subroutine name has not been duplicated.

 possibilities  mentioned  above should  consult with  their  Computing  Center

 A.  Introduction                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                        
      STARPAC  contains 36 subroutines  for producing  2 basic  styles  of line                                                         
 printer plots.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                        
      The first,  called a page plot, uses  a single 11 x 14 inch page  of line                                                         
 printer paper.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                        
      The second, called a vertical plot, is designed for plotting time series.                                                         
 The user specifies only the y-axis values since the x-axis values (independent                                                         
 variable)  are assumed to be  equally spaced  and ordered consecutively.   The                                                         
 independent variable in the resulting plot is oriented vertically and the plot                                                         
 will continue over as many pages as necessary to plot one point per line.                                                              
                                                                                                                                        
      Within  these two  basic  styles the  user has  many  options,  including                                                         
 controlling the plot symbol, plotting multivariate values, designating missing                                                         
 data, using log scales and specifying plot limits and plot size.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                        
      Users  are  directed  to  section  B  for  a  brief  description  of  the                                                         
 subroutines.  The  actual declaration and CALL statements are given in section                                                         
 C and the subroutine arguments are defined in section D.  The algorithms  used                                                         
 and  output  produced by these subroutines are discussed in section E.  Sample                                                         
 programs are shown in section F.

      PP (Page Plot) and VP (Vertical Plot) are the  simplest  of  the  STARPAC                                                         
 line printer plot subroutines.  For both, plot limits are automatically set by                                                         
 the  range  of  the  data  and other control parameters are set to the default                                                         
 values given in section D.  The remaining plotting subroutines  are  named  by                                                         
 adding letters to the beginning and/or end of PP and VP.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                        
      * Prefix S (e.g., SPP) indicates  the user  controls the plot  symbol for                                                         
        each point.

      Plotting Symbols.   The plotting symbol used depends on the  type of plot                                                         
 and whether or not more than one point falls on a given plot position.  If two                                                         
 to  nine points fall on a  single plot position, the integer  corresponding to                                                         
 the number of points is  used as the plotting symbol.   When 10 or more values                                                         
 fall on a single position the plotting symbol X is used.  This is the only way                                                         
 that integers or X are used as plot symbols.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                        
      Subroutines  without an  S or  M  prefix use  the plotting  symbol  +  to                                                         
 indicate one point on a single printer position.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                        
      For subroutines with an S prefix the user-supplied vector ISYM of integer                                                         
 values is  used to  specify the  plotting  symbol for  each data  point.   The                                                         
 Fourier spectrum plot shown in chapter 12 is an example of this option.                                                                
                                                                                                                                        
      Subroutines  with an M prefix use  a different letter as the  plot symbol                                                         
 for each column of the matrix of the dependent variables (y-axis):   A for the                                                         
 first, B for the second, ..., Z for columns  25 and beyond, with X  still only                                                         
 used to indicate that 10 or more points fell on a single plot position.                                                                
                                                                                                                                        
      Continuity of Vertical Plots.     Normally,   a    line   printer    will                                                         
 automatically  provide margins at the top  and bottom of each page,  causing a                                                         
 break in the continuity of a vertical plot or any other output continuing over                                                         
 two  or more pages.  However, these automatic page-ejects can be suppressed by

 NRANDC  is  then  used  to generate a sequence of normal pseudo-random numbers                                                         
 with a mean of 4 and standard deviation 0.5.  The same seed is used  for  both                                                         
 NRAND  and  NRANDC.  Therefore,  the values generated by NRANDC are YMEAN plus                                                         
 SIGMA times the values generated by NRAND, i.e.,                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                        
            YMEAN(I,2) = YMEAN + SIGMA*YMEAN(I,1) for I = 1, ..., N.

      STARPAC   contains   two  subroutines  for  producing  histograms.   Both                                                         
 subroutines  produce a one-page  printout which  includes, in addition  to the                                                         
 histogram, a number  of summary statistics (mean, median,  standard deviation,                                                         
 cell fractions, etc.) and several tests for normality.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                        
      Users  are  directed  to  section  B  for  a  brief  description  of  the                                                         
 subroutines.  The  declaration  and CALL statements are given in section C and                                                         
 the subroutine arguments are defined in section D.  The  algorithms  used  and                                                         
 output  produced  by  these  subroutines  are  discussed in section E.  Sample

      HIST provides  the  analysis  described  in  section  A  using  a  preset                                                         
 procedure for choosing the number of cells.  The lower and upper bounds of the                                                         
 histogram are chosen from the range of the observations.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                        
      HISTC provides the same analysis as  HIST but allows the user  to specify                                                         
 the number of cells and the  upper and lower cell boundaries.   Statistics are                                                         
 based only on the data within the user-supplied bounds.

      STARPAC contains two subroutines  for one-way analysis of variance.   The                                                         
 output from these subroutines  includes the  usual analysis of  variance table                                                         
 plus  the robust Kruskal-Wallis rank test.   Comprehensive summary  statistics                                                         
 are also given,  including means, standard deviations, standard  deviations of                                                         
 the  mean and confidence intervals for  the mean of each group.   Within group                                                         
 standard deviations, standard deviations of the mean and 95-percent confidence                                                         
 intervals for  the mean are  given assuming  fixed effects and  random effects                                                         
 models  and also assuming ungrouped data.   The output also includes pair-wise                                                         
 multiple  comparisons  using  the  Newman-Keuls and Scheffe'  techniques;  the

 confidence  interval for the mean are  printed for three different models:   a                                                         
 fixed effects model (Model I), a random  effects model (MODEL II) and  a model                                                         
 which assumes that all observations  are from a single group.   The confidence                                                         
 limits are formed by taking the grand mean plus (and minus) the product of the                                                         
 percentage point of Student's t distribution and the standard deviation of the                                                         
 mean.  Let k be the number of groups and n be the total number of observations                                                         
 with postitive tag.   Then, the  standard deviation of the mean  is the square                                                         
 root of the variance of the mean formed as follows:

      PAIRWISE MULTIPLE COMPARISON OF MEANS.   This section only appears if the                                                         
 significance  level (value of F PROB.)  of the between groups F-ratio  is less                                                         
 than 0.10.   The Newman-Keuls-Hartley procedure is not performed if the number                                                         
 of  measurements with  positive tag  is  less than  four plus  the  number  of

      The purpose of this comparison is to divide the groups in such a way that                                                         
 the group means within a division are not significantly different at  the 0.05                                                         
 significance level,  whereas  the  group  means  in  different  divisions  are                                                         
 significantly different at the 0.05 level.  Two different procedures are used:                                                         
 the  Newman-Keuls-Hartley method and the Scheffe' method.  The two methods are                                                         
 similar but not identical and frequently give slightly different results.  The                                                         
 Newman-Keuls-Hartley method is described in section 10.6  of  Snedecor  [1956]                                                         
 and  section  10.8  of  Snedecor  and  Cochran [1967].  The Scheffe' method is                                                         
 discussed in section 10.3 of  Brownlee  [1965].  Groups  are  separated  by  a                                                         
 string of five asterisks.  If two divisions have no group means in common, the                                                         
 two divisions are separated by two strings of five asterisks.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                        
      Both the  Newman-Keuls-Hartley method  and  the  Scheffe'  method require

 Mandel  is used  to compute them.   Since the  Newman-Keuls-Hartley method  is                                                         
 designed for  use when the number of  observations in each group is  the same,                                                         
 the number  of observations in each of  the two  groups is approximated  by m,                                                         
 where

 seven tables,  which, when used  together, aid  the user in  using correlation

      STARPAC contains 16 user-callable subroutines for nonlinear least squares                                                         
 regression.  Twelve of these are estimation subroutines that compute the least                                                         
 squares solution as described below, performing either weighted  or unweighted                                                         
 regression  with either  numerically approximated or  user-supplied (analytic)                                                         
 derivatives.   The estimation subroutines allow three levels of control of the                                                         
 computations and printed output, and allow the user to specify a subset of the                                                         
 parameters to be treated as constants,  with their values held fixed  at their                                                         
 input  values.   This last  feature allows  the user  to  examine the  results                                                         
 obtained  estimating various  subsets  of the  parameters of  a  general model                                                         
 without rewriting  the  model subroutine  for each  subset.   The  other  four                                                         
 subroutines described  in  this chapter  are utility  procedures  which choose                                                         
 optimum step  sizes  for numerically  approximating the  derivative  and which                                                         
 verify the correctness of user-supplied (analytic) derivatives.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
      Each  of the  subroutines  described in  this chapter  assumes  that  the

      The second order term Sp*,  which is expensive and difficult  to  compute

 nonlinear.  When  Sp*  is  large compared to trans(Dp)*W*Dp,  algorithms which                                                         
 ignore it,  such as Levenberg-Marquardt or Gauss-Newton,  may converge slowly.

 the  step  sizes  which  were  used  are  still  acceptable.  If  there  is  a

      The  sample programs  of this section  use the  model and  data  given in                                                         
 example one, pages 428 to 441 of Daniel and Wood [1980]; the model is                                                                  
                                                                                                                                        
             f(x(i),b) = PAR(1)*x(i,1)**PAR(2)  for i = 1, ..., N.

      Nonlinear Least Squares Estimation.  In the first example program  below,                                                         
 NLS   is  used  to  compute  the  least  squares  solution  using  numerically                                                         
 approximated derivatives.  In the second example  program,  NLSD  is  used  to                                                         
 compute the least squares solution given analytic derivatives.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
      Derivative  Step Size Selection.  In the third example program,  STPLS is                                                         
 used to compute the optimum  step  sizes  for  numerically  approximating  the                                                         
 derivatives with respect to each of the parameters, PAR(k), k = 1, 2.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
      Derivative Checking.  In the fourth example program below,  DCKLS is used                                                         
 to  check  the  validity  of  a  user-supplied  derivative   subroutine.   The                                                         
 derivative  subroutine  has  been  intentionally coded incorrectly in order to                                                         
 display the report obtained when the derivative checking subroutine determines                                                         
 the derivatives are incorrect,  and the starting parameter  values  have  been                                                         
 chosen  in  order  to  display  the  report obtained when the test results are

      In  general, each family  of subroutines  has one basic  subroutine which                                                         
 performs the  desired computations with  a minimum  of user input.   The other                                                         
 subroutines in  each family provide  greater flexibility  to the  user  at the                                                         
 price of more input.   The features of these subroutines are indicated  by the                                                         
 suffix letter(s) on the  subroutine (e.g., ACFM and BFSFS).   Not all features

 may be useful.   In other cases, careful model identification can  lead to the

 In addition, the periodogram values and their frequencies are returned  to the

 control the amount of  printed output;  the integrated periodogram  values and                                                         
 their  corresponding frequencies  are  also  returned  to  the  user  via  the

 time-consuming recomputation of  the periodogram  if it is  already available,                                                         
 for example, from subroutine PGMS.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
      Utilities.   STARPAC   includes   utility   subroutines   for   centering                                                         
 (subtracting the mean) and tapering the observed series, periodogram smoothing                                                         
 and  for computing the Fourier coefficients of the series.  These routines are                                                         
 particularly useful when using direct Fourier techniques such as PGM and IPGM.                                                         
                                                                                                                                        
      Subroutine CENTER subtracts the  series mean from the series  and returns                                                         
 the centered series.  There is no printed output.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                        
      Subroutine TAPER centers the input series and applies  the  split-cosine-                                                         
 bell  taper  described  for  argument YT in section D.  The user specifies the                                                         
 total proportion of the series to be tapered.  The centered tapered series  is                                                         
 returned  to  the  user  and  can  be used as input to subroutine PGM or PGMS.                                                         
 There is no printed output.

1     Subroutine FFTLEN computes for an observed series length, N,  the minimum                                                         
 extended  series length,  NFFT,  which  will  meet  the  requirements  of  the                                                         
 Singleton FFT code.   The value  of the extended series length  is returned to                                                         
 the user.  There is no printed output.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                        
      Subroutine MDFLT smooths the input periodogram by applying a  sequence of                                                         
 modified Daniell filters as discussed in chapter 7 of Bloomfield [1976].   The                                                         
 filtered  series  is  returned  to the  user.   There  is  no printed  output.                                                         
 Subroutine MDFLT takes advantage of  the symmetry of the periodogram  to avoid                                                         
 losing values from  the ends of the series.   It should  therefore not be used                                                         
 for input series that are not symmetric about their end values.  Other digital                                                         
 filtering  routines, such as those described  in chapter 10, may also  be used                                                         
 for periodogram smoothing but end effect losses will be incurred.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                        
      Subroutine FFTR computes the  Fourier coefficients of an input  series of                                                         
 single precision observations.  There is no printed output.

      Bivariate Spectrum Estimation Using the Fourier Transform  of  the  Cross                                                         
 Correlation  Function.  The BFS (Bivariate Fourier Spectrum) subroutine family                                                         
 computes the estimated spectrum from the Fourier transform of  the  covariance                                                         
 function  as  discussed in Jenkins and Watts [1968].  The spectrum is smoothed                                                         
 using Parzen windows with the bandwidth controlled either by  the  user  or  a

 consists  of  plots of the squared coherency and phase components of the cross                                                         
 spectrum.  The phase function plots reduce discontinuities  using  the  method                                                         
 suggested  by  Bloomfield [1976].  As shown in the example in section F,  this                                                         
 method displays both the principle phase value, which is defined to lie in the                                                         
 range -pi to pi,  and the principle phase value plus or minus 2*pi,  where the                                                         
 sign is chosen such that the second value lies in the range -2*pi to 2*pi.                                                             
                                                                                                                                        
      Subroutine  BFS  provides the basic analysis with a brief CALL statement.                                                         
 The printed output consists of four spectrum plot pairs (a  squared  coherency

 and the 95-percent significance levels are shown on the coherency plots.                                                               
                                                                                                                                        
      The other nine bivariate Fourier spectrum estimation  subroutines provide                                                         
 the basic analysis described for BFS while adding the features indicated above                                                         
 by suffixes S, M, F, V, FS, MS, VS, MV and MVS.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
      For the BFS family of subroutines,  the suffix S feature allows  the user                                                         
 to indicate:

      3)  whether the plot is to be in decibels or on a logarithmic scale.                                                              
 In addition, the squared coherency and phase values are returned to the user.

 In the fifth example program below,  TAPER is used to center the input  series                                                         
 and  to  taper  10 percent of the data at the ends of the series (5 percent at                                                         
 each end) and PGMS is used to compute  the  raw  periodogram  of  the  tapered

 used  are the Wolf sunspot numbers from 1700 to 1960 as tabulated by Waldmeier                                                         
 [1961].  The raw and smoothed periodograms of the tapered series are shown  on

               - what sections of the five-part printed report are wanted.                                                              
                                                                                                                                        
      AIMES has all the  features  of  AIMEC  and,  in  addition,  returns  the                                                         
 following estimated values via the argument list:

      The  simplest   of  the   three  ARIMA  forecasting   subroutines,  AIMF,                                                         
 automatically summarizes the  estimated results in a two-part  printed report.                                                         
 Forecasts are made using N as the origin  and extending [N/10] + 1  steps into                                                         
 the   future,    i.e.,   observations   are   forecast   for    indices   N+1,                                                         
 N+2, ..., N+[N/10]+1.  Many forecasting problems can be solved using AIMF.                                                             
                                                                                                                                        
      The second  forecasting  subroutine, AIMFS,  allows the  user  to  supply                                                         
 arguments to  indicate the number of forecasts  to be made, the origins  to be                                                         
 used  and  the amount  of printed  output.  This subroutine  also returns  the                                                         
 forecasts and their standard deviations via the argument list.

 respectively.  The  conventions  used to present the following declaration and

      Weighted  least squares can  be used  to eliminate observations  from the                                                         
 analysis and to compensate for unequal variances in the observational errors.                                                          
                                                                                                                                        
      Observations can be eliminated  from the analysis by using  weight values                                                         
 consisting  only of  zeros and ones.   This will  produce the  same results as                                                         
 performing an unweighted analysis with the zero-weighted values removed except                                                         
 that the predicted values,  the standard  deviations of the  predicted values,                                                         
 and the residuals of the zero-weighted data are computed.   There are two main                                                         
 reasons for weighting observations zero.  The first is to obtain the predicted                                                         
 values and their standard deviations  for a  set of independent  variables not                                                         
 included in the observed data.  (This is done by assigning any arbitrary value                                                         
 to the  dependent variable of  the desired  set of independent  variables, and                                                         
 then  weighting  these values  zero.)   The  second  reason is  to allow  easy                                                         
 examination of the effect of  outliers and influential data points.   Outliers                                                         
 often appear as large values in residual plots.   Careful checking of the data                                                         
 often leads  to confirmation that the data  are in  error, and sometimes  to a                                                         
 correction.   When a  cause for  suspicious data cannot  be found,  it may  be                                                         
 advisable  to compare the  analysis with  and without  the  questionable data.                                                         
 Caution is in order if the estimates or conclusions are highly sensitive  to a                                                         
 small amount of suspicious data.   Data that  have a very high influence  on a                                                         
 fitted curve may not result in large  residuals, however, even if they  are in                                                         
 error.  In fact, extremely influential observations may force the fitted curve                                                         
 to be very close, leading to very small residuals.   It is therefore desirable                                                         
 to identify influential observations and to compare the results  obtained with                                                         
 and  without  these  points.    Several  methods   for  detecting  influential                                                         
 observations are discussed in Bement and Williams [1969], Cook [1977], Hoaglin                                                         
 and Welsch [1978], and Belsley et al. [1980].                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                        
      Using weights to compensate for unequal observational error  variances is                                                         
 not as straightforward as  using zero  weights to eliminate  observations from                                                         
 the analysis.   When the variances of the observational errors, e(i), are  not                                                         
 equal, the unweighted least squares estimates remain unbiased but do  not have                                                         
 minimum variance.   Minimum variance  estimates are obtained by using  weights                                                         
 wti = 1/Variance[e(i)] when the error variances are known.  If weights must be                                                         
 estimated, they should be based on at least 10 degrees of freedom  [see Bement                                                         
 and Williams, 1969].   In practice, however, weights are derived from  theory,                                                         
 or obtained from the data being fit, and  either of these methods can  do more                                                         
 harm than  good.   When  the  need for  weights is  suspected  and  the  error                                                         
 variances are not known, first  fit the  data using unweighted  least squares;

 provide  estimates for  the weights themselves.   If the  need for  weights is
