      SELECT <br> Nijenhuis and Wilf <br> Combinatorial Selection Algorithm
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SELECT</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      implements the Nijenhuis and Wilf Combinatorial Selection Algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the reference, Nijenhuis and Wilf presented particular
      algorithms to rank, unrank, enumerate, sequentially generate,
      or randomly generate objects from a variety of combinatorial
      families, such as K-subsets of an N-set, permutations,
      partitions, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the course of this development, they come across a number
      of cases where, to determine the number B(N,K) of objects of size
      K in a family of maximum size N, a recurrence is used of the form
      <blockquote>
        B(N,K) = PHI(N,K) * B(N1,K1) + PSI(N,K) * B(N2,K2)
      </blockquote>
      Typically, but not always, it is the case that:
      <pre>
        N1 = N - 1
        N2 = N - 1
        K1 = K
        K2 = K - 1
      </pre>
      and the values of the coefficient functions PHI and PSI
      depended on the family.
    </p>

    <p>
      This pattern suggested that a single abstract approach could
      be used to carry out the usual tasks for a variety of combinatorial
      families.  The result was a subroutine called <b>SELECT</b> which
      while not optimized for a particular family, displays their
      common underlying structure, and allows new families to be
      added easily.
    </p>

    <p>
      The combinatorial families are indicated by the value of the
      variable <b>FAMILY</b>, and characterized by a "big" size <b>N</b>
      and a smaller size <b>K</b>:
      <ol>
        <li>
          K subsets of an N set;
        </li>
        <li>
          Partitions of N objects into K classes;
        </li>
        <li>
          Permutations of N objects with K cycles;
        </li>
        <li>
          Vector subspaces of dimension K over N-dimensional space
          over the field of order Q (where Q is currently set to 2 );
        </li>
        <li>
          Permutations of N letters with K runs;
        </li>
        <li>
          Partitions of N whose largest part is K;
        </li>
        <li>
          Compositions of N into K parts.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      The combinatorial tasks, indicated by the value of the
      variable <b>TASK</b>, include
      <ol>
        <li>
          Present each object of the family, one at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rank a given object of the family.
        </li>
        <li>
          Produce an object of given rank.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select an object at random.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enumerate the objects.
        </li>
      </ol>
