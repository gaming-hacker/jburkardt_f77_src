SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_PRB
  FORTRAN77 version
  Test the SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH library.

TEST01
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH maps from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_INVERSE is the inverse map.
  Check that these two functions are inverses.

  Map points from sphere to plane to sphere.
  Frobenius difference for    100 points was   0.452245E-14

  Map points from plane to sphere to plane.
  Frobenius difference for    100 points was   0.636729E-15

TEST02
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH standard mapping from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH2 generalized mapping:
  (focus and center are arbitrary)
  Check that these two functions can agree.
