      HELLO_MPI <br> Hello World, Using MPI
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HELLO_MPI</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 program which 
      prints out "Hello, World!", while invoking the MPI parallel programming
      system.  
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're just trying to learn MPI, or learning how to use
      MPI on a different computer system, or in batch mode, it's helpful
      if you start with a very simple program with a tiny amount of output
      that should print immediately if things are working well.
