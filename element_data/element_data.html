      ELEMENT_DATA <br> Preprocess data for DISPLAY4
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ELEMENT_DATA</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 program which 
      preprocesses
      simple element-based data on a grid into a form that the 
      <a href = "../../f_src/display4/display4.html">DISPLAY4 program</a> can handle.
    </p>

    <p>
      A set of nodes are specified in a region, and groups of 4 nodes
      comprise elements.  At each node, a set of physical quantities is
      given, in particular, the X and Y coordinates, the fluid pressure P,
      and the horizontal and vertical flow velocity components U and V.
      This information has been written into a file.  That information
      must be reformatted to work with <b>DISPLAY4</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically, for each node, there is at least one line of the form:
      <pre>
        X  Y  P  PSI  U  V  W
      </pre>
      where PSI (presumably the stream function) and W (the magnitude of
      (U,V)) are not of interest to us.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Each element is represented by
      listing the nodes that comprise it, with the initial node repeated
      at the end, followed by a blank line.  All elements in the current
      data set comprise 4 nodes.  Thus, the information defining one element
      would be the central lines of the following:
      <pre>
         (previous element just finishing up)
         X1  Y1  P1  PSI1  U1  V1  W1

         X1  Y1  P1  PSI1  U1  V1  W1
         X2  Y2  P2  PSI2  U2  V2  W2
         X3  Y3  P3  PSI3  U3  V3  W3
         X4  Y4  P4  PSI4  U4  V4  W4
         X1  Y1  P1  PSI1  U1  V1  W1

         X1  Y1  P1 PSI1 U1 V1 W1
         (New element being defined)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>DISPLAY4</b>, on the other hand, expects two data files, a
      <i>node data file</i>, which lists each node once, and the properties
      U, V, and P:
      <pre>
        X Y U V P
      </pre>
      which implicitly assigns an index to each node,
      and an <i>element data file</i>, which lists the number of elements,
      the number of nodes per element, and then, for each element, the
      node indices related to the element:
      <pre>
        1024
        4
        N1 N2 N3 N4
        N1 N2 N3 N4
        ...
        ...(1024 records like this)
        ...
        N1 N2 N3 N4
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>ELEMENT_DATA</b> reads the old data, counts items, discards duplicate
      node information, and writes out the two data files needed by
      <b>DISPLAY4</b>.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The name of the input file is usually specified on the command line:
      <pre>
        element_data <i>input_file</i>
      </pre>
      The output files are always named <i>element.txt</i> and <i>node.txt</i>.
