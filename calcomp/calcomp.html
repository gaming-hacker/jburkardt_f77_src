      CALCOMP <br> PostScript Emulation of some CALCOMP Plotting Commands.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CALCOMP</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which 
      accepts several
      calls to Calcomp plotter routines, and tries to create a PostScript
      file corresponding to the desired image.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Calcomp plotter was an ancient pen and paper plotting device.
      One memorable feature of the accompanying software was the strange
      use of the <b>PLOT</b> command, which had arguments X, Y, and IPEN.
      When IPEN was 2 or 3, the command resulted in pen drawing or movement,
      but other values of IPEN had special meanings.  In particular, 
      the value of 999 was used to terminate the plot.  It's bizarre
      and clunky features like this that stick in one's memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      This library assumes that the user's input data has been scaled to
      fit on a standard "portrait style" page of dimensions 8.5 by 11
      inches.  If the user's data does not fall within this range,
      the plot will not be drawn correctly.
