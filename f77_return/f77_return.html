      F_RETURN <br> FORTRAN Programs Can Return Program Status Value 
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>F_RETURN</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      demonstrates how a FORTRAN90 program can return a program status value.
    </p>

    <p>
      C and C++ programs can return an integer value signalling the status
      of the program's execution.  By convention, a return value of 0 indicates
      that the program executed successfully, while a nonzero value indicates
      some kind of error.
    </p>

    <p>
      The return value of such a program can be retrieved and used to make
      decisions.  In particular, if the execution of the program is part of
      a script, then the failure of the program can be detected, and the
      script can terminate gracefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      For an example in the BASH shell, we might have a script that reads:
      <pre>
        ./prog
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Errors while running prog."
          exit
        fi
      </pre>
      Here, $? is a BASH symbol that returns the most recent program status
      value, and the script exits if that value is not zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      FORTRAN has always had the option to include a constant integer value 
      as part of the STOP statement.  At least some FORTRAN compilers can
      treat this value as a  program status value that is returned to the
      calling environment, and hence can signal whether certain errors
      have occurred.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, we show a simple example in which the program is guaranteed
      to fail, and in that case will return the arbitrary but nonzero value 13.
