    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>complex_numbers_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN77 program which
      demonstrates very briefly some of the features of using complex
      numbers. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first issue is how to declare a complex variable, including
      the choice of single precision or double precision, whether
      the variable is a scalar, vector, or array, and whether the variable
      is initialized with a value, or assigned one.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second issue concerns the question of how a complex variable is
      to be printed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns how a complex variable is to operated on
      by the arithmetic operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
      division, and exponentiation.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The language also provides a number of intrinsic functions that
      can be applied to a complex variable.  The names of these functions
      can sometimes be easy to forget.  Moreover, it is occasionally true
      that there may be a selection of functions with similar names
      (say, "exp", "cexp" and "dcexp") which may or may not produce the
      desired results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns the details of double precision calculation.
      Even a single accidental use of a single precision function name
      in a double precision computation can result in the loss of half
      the digits of accuracy.  Thus, it sometimes really matters whether
      you use "cmplx" or "dcmplx" to assign values to a double precision
      complex variable.
