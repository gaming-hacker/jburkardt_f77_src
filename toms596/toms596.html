      TOMS596 <br> Continuation Code for Parameterized Nonlinear Equations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TOMS596</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      carries out the continuation method for producing a series of
      solutions of a set of nonlinear equations with one degree of freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is designed for problems in which <b>N</b> variables <b>X</b>
      are constrained by <b>N</b>-1 nonlinear equations <b>F(X)=0</b>.
      Generally, there is an entire family of solutions to such a problem,
      which can be thought of as a curve in <b>N</b>-dimensional space.
      We can imagine this curve parameterized by a variable <b>LAMBDA</b>.
      Given one solution <b>(X,LAMBDA0)</b>, the program attempts to determine
      more points on the curve of solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The copy of the program distributed through NETLIB is the original version.
      However, the original version was written with the assumption that local
      memory in subroutines was saved in between calls.  This assumption is not
      generally true.  The version of the code presented here has been modified
      by the insertion of the appropriate SAVE statements to guarantee that
      local variable values are preserved.

      definition of the curve from the function f(x,y)=x^2+y^2-1.
