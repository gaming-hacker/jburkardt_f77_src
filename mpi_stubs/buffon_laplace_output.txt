 
BUFFON_LAPLACE - Master process:
  FORTRAN77 version
  An MPI example program to estimate PI
  in the Buffon-Laplace needle experiment.
  On a grid of cells of width A and height B,
  a needle of length L is dropped.
  We count the number of times it crosses
  at least one grid line, and use this to
  estimate the value of PI.
 
  The number of processes is        1
