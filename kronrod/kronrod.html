      KRONROD <br> Gauss-Kronrod Quadrature Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>KRONROD</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      computes both a Gauss quadrature rule of order N, and the
      Gauss-Kronrod rule of order 2*N+1.
    </p>

    <p>
      A pair of Gauss and Gauss-Kronrod quadrature rules are typically
      used to provide an error estimate for an integral.  The integral
      is estimated using the Gauss rule, and then the Gauss-Kronrod
      rule provides a higher precision estimate.  The difference between
      the two estimates is taken as an approximation to the level
      of error.
    </p>

    <p>
      The advantage of using a Gauss and Gauss-Kronrod pair is that
      the second rule, which uses 2*N+1 points, actually includes the
      N points in the previous Gauss rule.  This means that the function
      values from that computation can be reused.  This efficiency comes
      at the cost of a mild reduction in the degree of polynomial precision of the
      Gauss-Kronrod rule.
