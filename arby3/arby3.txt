c
c  The ARBY program works on an underlying fluid flow problem, whose
c  behavior is determined by a particular version of the Navier Stokes
c  equations.
c
c  The fluid flow in the region is described by three functions of position,
c  the horizontal velocity U(x,y),  vertical velocity V(x,y), and pressure
c  P(x,y).  In theory, these functions may be determined once we know the
c  partial differential equations that govern them within the region, and
c  the value of the functions or certain derivatives of them along the boundary
c  of the region.
c
c  For our work, we assume that at every point within the flow region, the flow
c  functions obey the Navier Stokes equations for stationary, incompressible,
c  viscous flow:
c
c    - nu*(ddU/dxdx + ddU/dydy) + U dU/dx + V dU/dy + dP/dx  = 0
c
c    - nu*(ddV/dxdx + ddV/dydy) + U dV/dx + V dV/dy + dP/dy  = 0
c
c    dU/dx + dV/dy = 0
c
c  Here, nu is a physical parameter called the "dynamic viscosity,"
c
c  We prefer the equivalent formulation (when nu is nonzero):
c
c    - (ddU/dxdx + ddU/dydy) + Re*(U dU/dx + V dU/dy + dP/dx)  = 0
c
c    - (ddV/dxdx + ddV/dydy) + Re*(U dV/dx + V dV/dy + dP/dy)  = 0
c
c    dU/dx + dV/dy = 0
c
c  where Re is taken to be the Reynolds number.
c
c  If Re=0, the problem is linear, and is called a Stokes flow.
c
c  To complete the specification of the problem, we specify boundary conditions
c  for the flow functions.
c
c  There are two problems built in to the code.  The boundary conditions
c  for the channel flow are:
c
c    The values of U and V are specified along the left boundary;
c    U and V must be zero along the upper and lower walls, and on
c      the surface of a bump along the lower wall;
c    dU/dn must be zero, and V must be zero, at the outflow;
c    P must be zero at a single point on the boundary.
c
c  The boundary conditions for the driven cavity are:
c
c    The values of U and V are specified along the top boundary;
c    U and V must be zero along the left, right, and bottom walls;
c    P must be zero at a single point on the boundary.
c
c
c  THE ROLE OF THE DYNAMIC VISCOSITY
c
c  Nu is a physical parameter called the "dynamic viscosity," or
c  occasionally the "inverse Reynolds number".  We explicitly assume that
c  nu is not zero.  Nu has a very strong influence on the form of the solution,
c  and even on the actual solvability of the equations.  As nu decreases
c  in value, the velocity functions pass from the placid flow characteristic
c  of a thick syrup, through patterns typical of rapidly moving water, to the
c  wildly irregular behavior of high speed air.  With decreasing nu, the 
c  equations themselves become more difficult to solve; for small enough nu 
c  there may be no solution, or multiple solutions.
c
c
c  DERIVATION OF FINITE ELEMENT EQUATIONS
c
c  Except for special cases, such as the Poiseuille flow solution discussed
c  elsewhere, there are no methods of producing the exact solution functions
c  U, V and P for a general Navier Stokes problem.  In order to get any
c  insight into flow problems, we must replace the original problem by one
c  that is much weaker.  It's important that the weaker problem be possible
c  to solve, and that the solutions produced are in general close to solutions
c  of the original problem, and that these solutions can be made even closer,
c  if desired.
c
c  A standard method of doing this is to use the method of finite elements.
c
c  To do so, we assume that instead of being smooth but otherwise completely
c  arbitrary functions, that U, V and P are representable as linear
c  combinations of a finite set of basis functions.
c
c  We multiply the first two equations by an arbitrary velocity basis
c  function Wi, and the third equation by an arbitrary pressure basis
c  function Qi, and integrate over the region.  The integrand of the
c  resulting finite element equations is then transformed, using
c  integration by parts, into:
c
c
c    (dU/dx*dWi/dx + dU/dy*dWi/dy) + Re*(U*dU/dx + V*dU/dy + dP/dx ) * Wi
c
c    (dV/dx*dWi/dx + dV/dy*dWi/dy) + Re*(U*dV/dx + V*dV/dy + dP/dy ) * Wi
c
c    (dU/dx + dV/dy) * Qi
c
c
c  These integrands may be rewritten using the program's variable names:
c
c
c    dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy + reynld*(U*dUdx+V*dUdy+dPdx)*wi
c
c    dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy + reynld*(U*dVdx+V*dVdy+dPdy)*wi
c
c    (dUdx + dVdy) * qi
c
c
c  This system of nonlinear equations is then solved by Newton's method.
c  That means that we have to differentiate each nonlinear equation
c  with respect to the unknowns, getting the Jacobian matrix, and
c  solving DF(X) * DEL(X) = -F(X).  If we abuse notation, we can
c  consider the linear system DF(X) * DEL(X):
c
c  Here, variables in capital letters are to be solved for, but
c  the same variable names in lowercase represent the current
c  values of those same variables.
c
c
c  d Horizontal Equation/d U coefficient * U coefficient:
c
c    dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy + reynld*(U*dudx+u*dUdx+v*dUdy)*wi
c
c  d Horizontal Equation/d V coefficient * V coefficient:
c
c                              reynld*V*dudy*wi
c
c  d Horizontal Equation/d P coefficient * P coefficient:
c
c                              reynld*dPdx*wi
c
c  d Vertical Equation/d U coefficient * U coefficient:
c
c                              reynld*U*dvdx*wi
c
c  d Vertical Equation/d V coefficient * V coefficient:
c
c    dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy + reynld*(u*dVdx+v*dVdy+V*dvdy)*wi
c
c  d Vertical Equation/d P coefficient * P coefficient:
c
c                              reynld*dPdy*wi
c
c  d Pressure Equation/d U coefficient * U coefficient:
c
c    dUdx * qi
c
c  d Pressure Equation/d V coefficient * V coefficient:
c
c    dVdx * qi
c
c
c  Now let us assume that U, V and P depend in some way on a parameter
c  Z, and let us consider differentiating each of the three above
c  equations with respect to Z.  Then we interchange differentiation
c  where desired, and come up with equations for the sensitivities.
c
c  Now the sensitivities should be written as (dU/dZ, dV/dZ, dP/dZ).
c  In the ensuing equations, we will write them as (U, V, P), but
c  now the lower case letters (u, v, p) represent the current values
c  of the original fluid flow quantities.
c
c
c  Sensitivity equations for the inflow parameters:
c
c    dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy
c      + reynld*(U*dudx+u*dUdx+V*dudy+v*dUdy+dPdx)*wi = 0
c
c    dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy
c      + reynld*(U*dvdx+u*dVdx+V*dvdy+v*dVdy+dPdy)*wi = 0
c
c    (dUdx + dVdy) * qi = 0
c
c    Boundary conditions:
c
c    0 at walls and at the outflow.
c
c    Spline(I,Y) at the point (0,Y) of the inflow.  Here, Spline(I,Y) is
c    the value of the spline associated with the I-th inflow parameter,
c    at the point Y.
c
c
c  Sensitivity equations for the bump parameters:
c
c    dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy
c      + reynld*(U*dudx+u*dUdx+V*dudy+v*dUdy+dPdx)*wi = 0
c
c    dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy
c      + reynld*(U*dvdx+u*dVdx+V*dvdy+v*dVdy+dPdy)*wi = 0
c
c    (dUdx + dVdy) * qi = 0
c
c    Boundary conditions:
c
c    0 everywhere except on the bump.
c
c    ? on the bump.
c
c
c  Sensitivity equations for the REYNLD parameter:
c
c    dUdx*dwidx + dUdy*dwidy
c      + reynld*(U*dudx+u*dUdx+V*dudy+v*dUdy+dPdx)*wi
c      +        (u*dudx+v*dudy+dpdx)*wi = 0
c
c    dVdx*dwidx + dVdy*dwidy
c      + reynld*(U*dvdx+u*dVdx+V*dvdy+v*dVdy+dPdy)*wi
c      +        (u*dvdx+v*dvdy+dpdy)*wi = 0
c
c    (dUdx + dVdy) * qi = 0
c
c    Boundary conditions:
c
c    0 everywhere.
c
c  In the case of the REYNLD parameter, we carry the "extra" terms
c
c    (u*dvdx+v*dvdy+dpdy)*wi
c
c  to the right hand side, and treat it as a source term.  In that case,
c  all these sensitivity equations have the same form as the original
c  equations for (U, V, P).

c
c  Poiseuille flow
c
c
c  Consider a horizontal channel of constant height h, and of length l.
c
c  Suppose a parabolic inflow is specified at the left hand opening,
c  of the form
c
c    u(y) = s * y * (h-y)
c    v(y) = 0
c    p(y) = 0
c
c  where S is any value.
c
c  Then the following functions (U,V,P) solve the Navier Stokes
c  equations in the region:
c
c    u(x,y) = s * y * (h-y)
c    v(x,y) = 0
c    p(x,y) = -2*s*x*nu
c
c  The standard problem we use has h=3, l=10, and chooses a parameter Lambda
c  so that the maximum value of the parabolic inflow is Lambda.  Then our
c  formula becomes:
c
c    u(x,y) = Lambda * (4/9) * y * (3-y)
c    v(x,y) = 0
c    p(x,y) = -2 * Lambda * (4/9) * x * Re

c  The following technical information describes various geometric facts
c  about the program.
c
c
c  1) The finite element nodes
c
c  If the region is rectangular, then the nodes are placed in such a way
c  that they are evenly spaced in the X direction, and in the Y direction,
c  although these two spacings may be different.
c
c  The first node is in the lower left corner.  The second node is the one
c  immediately above the first, and then numbering proceeds upwards, and then
c  over to the next column.  For instance:

c  THE CHANNEL PROBLEM

c  The flow region is essentially a long channel (10 units long, 3
c  units high) open at both ends, except that there is a small, variable
c  bump along the bottom.

c  Flow values are sampled along the line X=XPROF.
c  The bump extends from point L=(XBL,YBL) to point R=(XBR,YBR).
c
c  The mesh is rectangular, except above the bump, where it is smoothly
c  graded.  Vertical mesh lines stay vertical, but the shape of the
c  bottom and top are "averaged" to provide the horizontal mesh lines.

c  THE STEP PROBLEM
c
c  The flow region is essentially a long channel (10 units long, 3
c  units high) open at both ends, except that there is a vertical
c  step along the bottom.

c
c  U and V are zero along the top and bottom walls and the step.
c  Pressure is zero at the point "P".
c  U and V are specified at the inflow I.
c  dU/dX is zero, and V is zero, at the outflow O.
c  Flow values are sampled along the line X=XPROF.
c  The step extends from point L=(XBL,YBL) to point R=(XBR,YBR).
c
c  The mesh is rectangular.  One mesh line is forced to lie on the
c  upper step surface.  Elements that lie in the "dead" region have
c  U=V=P=0.
