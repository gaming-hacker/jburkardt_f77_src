VERSION 3.0 OF SPHEREPACK CREATED TO
ELIMINATE ARGUMENT TYPE CONFLICTS.


The web site

     (http://www.scd.ucar.edu/css/software/spherepack )

includes a description and instructions for downloading
the SPHEREPACK software and NCAR tech note.

A new version 3.0 of spherepack has been created to
correct a problem with unsaved real, double precision, and integer
work space passage. The changes made will require users to
modify their calls to some spherepack routines.  These modifications
are critical, but very simple, and will be specified below.

In several user called subroutines of version 2.0,
a real work space argument is passed to lower level subroutines
where it is used as a double precision work space.  In several
of the graphics routines, a real work space is used as type integer.
Such type conflicts are nonstandard Fortran and can cause run-time 
failure on some systems (e.g. SGI Power Challenge).

To correct the type conflicts, it was necessary to modify the argument 
lists in version 3.0 in three ways which are described in Categories A,B,C
below.  None of the routine names have changed.  The affected subroutines 
are listed under each category along with an example of how to call them.

CATEGORY A ARGUMENT CHANGES:
----------------------------

These are user called subroutines for which a
double precision unsaved work space "dwork" of length "ldwork"
replaces a real unsaved work space "work" of length "lwork".
The affected user called subroutines are:

   shaeci,shseci (in files shaec.f,shsec.f respectively)
   shagci,shsgci (in files shagc.f,shsgc.f respectively)
   vhaeci,vhseci (in files vhaec.f,vhsec.f respectively)
   vhagci,vhsgci (in files vhagc.f,vhsgc.f respectively)
   vtseci,vtsgci (in files vtsec.f,vtsgc.f respectively)
   gaqd (in file gaqd.f)
   shigc (in file shigc.f)

Example A:

In Version 2.0

     CALL VHAGCI(NLAT,NLON,WVHAGC,LVHAGC,WORK,LWORK,IERROR)

where LWORK is at least 4*NLAT*(NLAT+1)+2 is replaced by

     CALL VHAGCI(NLAT,NLON,WVHAGC,LVHAGC,DWORK,LDWORK,IERROR)

in version 3.0 of spherepack.  The unsaved double precision work
space DWORK has length LDWORK which is at least 2*NLAT*(NLAT+1)+1
(see documentation in file vhagc.f).  The other arguments remain
identical in the two versions of spherepack.

CATEGORY B ARGUMENT CHANGES:
----------------------------

A double precision unsaved work space "DWORK" of length "LDWORK"
is added to the argument list of the affected subroutines after the real
unsaved work space "WORK" of length "LWORK."  The value of "LWORK" remains
unchanged.  The affected subroutines are:

   shaesi,shsesi (in files shaes.f,shses.f)
   vhaesi,vhsesi (in files vhaes.f,vhses.f)
   vtsesi,vtsgsi (in files vtses.f,vtsgs.f)
   shigs (in file shigs.f)
   helmsph (in file helmsph.f)
   trssph,trvsph (in files trssph.f,trvsph.f)
   testrssph,testrvsph (in files testrssph.f,testrvsph.f)
   tadvec (in file tadvec.f)

Example B:

In version 2.0

     CALL VHSESI(NLAT,NLON,WVHAGC,LVHAGC,WORK,LWORK,IERROR)

is replaced by

     CALL VHSESI(NLAT,NLON,WVHAGC,LVHAGC,WORK,LWORK,DWORK,LDWORK,IERROR)

by adding the two new arguments DWORK and LDWORK in version 3.0.
In this case, the length of the unsaved double precision work space
DWORK in LDWORK must be at least 2*(NLAT+1) words long in the
routine calling VHSESI (see documentation for VHSESI in file vhses.f).
The minimum length of WORK in LWORK remains the same in versions 2.0
and 3.0 of spherepack.

CATEGORY C ARGUMENT CHANGES:
----------------------------

The following graphics routines in spherepack had
a type integer work space "IWORK" added to
their arguement list after the real work space "WORK."

    visgeo (in file visgeo.f)
    visequ (in file visequ.f)
    visgau (in file visgau.f)
    vsurf (in file vsurf.f)

Example C:

In version 2.0

      CALL  SUBROUTINE VISGEO (M,IDP,JDP,X,Y,Z,H,EYER,EYELAT,EYELON,
     +                         WORK,IERROR)

is replaced by

      CALL  SUBROUTINE VISGEO (M,IDP,JDP,X,Y,Z,H,EYER,EYELAT,EYELON,
     +                         WORK,IWORK,IERROR)

The required lengths for the real unsaved work space "WORK" and integer
unsaved work space "IWORK" are described in the documentation which is
in file visgeo.f.

Binary Library Changes on SCD/NCAR Computers
--------------------------------------------
Local library libsphere3.a has been created on these SCD/NCAR computers:
winterpark (SGI Challenge), antero, aztec, chipeta, ouray, and paiute
(Cray parallel vector).  On July 20, the old library libsphere.a will
be removed and users must cut over to libsphere3.a, with the changes to 
their SPHEREPACK subroutine calls specified above.  You must also change
your f77 or f90 invokations to use compiler flag -lsphere3 instead of
-lsphere.
