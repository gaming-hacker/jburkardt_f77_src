HELLO
  FORTRAN77 version
 
  An OpenMP sample program.
 
  Each parallel thread identify itself.
 
  The number of processors available:
  OMP_GET_NUM_PROCS () =        1
 
  Call OMP_SET_NUM_THREADS, and request        4 threads.
 
  Calling OMP_GET_NUM_THREADS outside a 
  parallel region, we get the number of
  threads is        1
 
  This is process        0
 
  Calling OMP_GET_NUM_THREADS inside a 
  parallel region, we get the number of
  threads is   1
 
 
HELLO
  Normal end of execution.
