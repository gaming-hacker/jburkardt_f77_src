synopsis of the library.


Bugfixes from FFTPACK 5.0 to FFTPACK 5.1
----------------------------------------
The functionality of FFTPACK 5.1 is identical with the previous version 5.0.
The following bugfixes have been applied:

1) Corrected index error for high-level routines [CR]FFT[12][BFI] requiring 
   WSAVE array, and all dependent routines to which LWSAVE is passed. 
   Namely, in LWSAV = L + LOG(REAL(INT(L))) + 4 definitions, the summand term 
   LOG(REAL(INT(L))) has been corrected to LOG(REAL(INT(L)/LOG(2.)).

2) Corrected index error in routime C1FM1F at label 56, where array offset 
   was declared 1 that should have been 2. This resulted in C1FFTF transforms 
   of length N calculated incorrectly, where N is any prime .GT. 5, or N=7*M, 
   M .GE. 6.

3) Corrected RFFT2x routines by rewriting them. The backward transform 
   followed by forward now returns identity.  Input argument LENSAV must be
   be at least 
   L + 3*M + INT(LOG(REAL(L))/LOG(2.)) + 2*INT(LOG(REAL(M))/LOG(2.)) +12.
   Previously, the required value was smaller.

Compiling the Library
---------------------
The included Makefile is configured to build a static
library on most currently availble unix and unix-like
operating systems.  The given make targets (type "make"
without any arguments for a list of targets) correspond
to compiler names; e.g. intel = Intel F95 compiler, 
gnu = GNU g77 compiler, sun = Sun Solaris compiler, etc.

The source code is by default configured for single precision
real numbers.  If double precision is desired, the Makefile must
be modified with the appropriate compiler options for promoting
real to double precision as well as promoting constants to double
precision (this is often "-r8" on some, but not all, compilers).

Library FFTPACK 5.1 contains 1D, 2D, and multiple fast Fourier
subroutines, written in Fortran 77, for transforming real and complex
data, real even and odd wave data, and real even and odd quarter-wave
data.

All of the FFTPACK 5.1 routines listed above are grouped in triplets
e.g. {CFFT1I, CFFT1F, CFFT1B}.  The suffix "I" denotes "initialize",
"F" denotes "forward" (as in "forward transform") and "B" denotes
"backward".  In an application program, before calling "B" or "F"
routines for the first time, or before calling them with a different
length, users must initialize an array by calling the "I" routine of
the appropriate pair or triplet.  Note that "I" routines need not be
called each time before a "B" or "F" routine is called.

All of the transform routines in FFTPACK 5.1 are normalized.

Error messages are written to unit 6 by routine XERFFT.  The
standard version of XERFFT issues an error message and halts execution,
so that no FFTPACK 5.1 routine will return to the calling program with
error return IER different than zero.  Users may consider modifying the
STOP statement in order to call system-specific exception-handling
facilities.

FFTPACK 5.1 is written in standard Fortran 77 except for several
instances where arrays of type REAL or COMPLEX are passed to a
subroutine and used as a different type.
