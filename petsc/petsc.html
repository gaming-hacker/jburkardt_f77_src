      PETSc <br> FORTRAN77 Examples
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      This directory includes examples of the use of <b>PETSc</b> with
      a calling program written in FORTRAN77.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSc</b> is a library of high level mathematical routines
      that can be executed in a parallel environment, making it
      easier for a user to gain the advantages of MPI.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSc</b> stands for the Portable Extensible Toolkit for 
      Scientific Computations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSc</b> is particularly suitable for the numerical
      solution of systems of partial differential equations
      on high performance computers.  <b>PETSc</b> includes 
      parallel linear and nonlinear equation solvers and
      time integrators that may be used by application programs
      written in C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSc</b> consists of a number of libraries which work
      with a particular family of objects, such as vectors.
      Some of the <b>PETSc</b> modules deal with
      <ul>
        <li>
          index sets, including permutations;
        </li>
        <li>
          vectors;
        </li>
        <li>
          matrices, especially sparse matrices;
        </li>
        <li>
          distributed arrays, as when the data for a single matrix
          is distributed over a set of processors;
        </li>
        <li>
          Krylov subspace methods for solving linear systems;
        </li>
        <li>
          preconditioners for linear algebra systems, including
          multigrid and sparse direct solvers;
        </li>
        <li>
          solvers for systems of nonlinear equations;
        </li>
        <li>
          partial differential equation solvers;
        </li>
        <li>
          time steppers for time-dependent partial differential equations;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSc</b> includes parts of the following software libraries:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "../../f_src/blas1/blas1.html">BLAS1</a> vector library,
        </li>

          direct solver of Henry Tufo and Paul Fischer,

          reordering routines.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSc</b> runs in parallel by relying on:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "../mpi/mpi.html">MPI</a>, the message-passing 
          interface library,
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      A FORTRAN77 program that uses <b>PETSc</b> must specify many
      include files, from the basis level up to the level
      corresponding to the highest level <b>PETSc</b> objects
      needed within that program.  That means that the user source
      code will include statements like
      <blockquote><code>
        #include "include/finclude/petsc.h"
        #include "include/finclude/petscvec.h"
        #include "include/finclude/petscmat.h"
        #include "include/finclude/petscksp.h"
        #include "include/finclude/petscpc.h"
      </code></blockquote>  
      Moreover, the user source code must be passed through the
      C preprocessor in order for the text of the include files
      to be accessed.  This means that the source code extension
      must be ".F", that is CAPITAL "F".
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Before using <b>PETSc</b>, the user must set the environment
      variable <code>PETSC_DIR</code>, indicating the full path of the
      <b>PETSc</b> home directory.  On Phoenix, for instance, this might
      be done with the command
      <blockquote><code>
        setenv PETSC_DIR /usr/local/petsc
      </code></blockquote>
      This command might best be placed in the user's <code>.cshrc</code>
      file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before using <b>PETSc</b>, the user must set the environment
      variable <code>PETSC_ARCH</code>, indicating the architecture of the
      machine on which <b>PETSc</b> is to be run.  On Phoenix, for instance, 
      this might be done with the command
      <blockquote><code>
        setenv PETSC_ARCH linux-gnu
      </code></blockquote>
      This command might best be placed in the user's <code>.cshrc</code>
      file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The commands required to compile, link and load a program with
      <b>PETSc</b> are complicated.  It is best to use a makefile for
      this purpose, in which case most of the complications can be
      hidden.  A bare bones makefile for the example <i>ex1.F</i>,
      which is going to use <b>PETSc</b>'s Krylov Subspace Package (KSP),
      would look like this:
      <pre>
include ${PETSC_DIR}/bmake/common/base

ex1: ex1.o
	-${FLINKER} -o ex1 ex1.o ${PETSC_FORTRAN_LIB} ${PETSC_LIB}
      </pre>
      To use this makefile, one simply types
      <blockquote><code>
        make ex1
      </code></blockquote>
      and the executable will be created.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>mpirun</b> command may be used for <b>SMALL</b> jobs
      that run for a <b>SHORT</b> time on <b>FEW</b> processors.
      Repeated use of the <b>mpirun</b> command for large long jobs
      is an abuse of the system and will not be allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      To run a program that uses <b>PETSc</b>, the user may invoke the
      <b>mpirun</b> command, specifying the number of processors.
      <blockquote><code>
        mpirun -np 4 <i>ex1</i>
      </code></blockquote>
      The <b>mpirun</b> command will automatically log the user into
      3 more nodes of Phoenix, (requiring the user to type in a password
      each time!).
    </p>

    <p>
      To run a program that uses <b>PETSc</b>, the CONDOR system is
      preferable.  This is a batch system which tries to be fair
      and efficient in the allocation of computing resources.
      To use CONDOR, the user should create an executable program,
      then prepare a "CONDOR submit script" that describes how the
      executable is to be run, and on how many processors, and submit 
      the script.  Details and examples of how to do this are
      given on the 
      <a href = "../../examples/condor/condor.html">CONDOR</a> 
      examples page.

      <b>MAKEFILE</b> contains the information necessary to properly
      compile, link and load the various user examples.  If you use
      <b>PETSc</b>, you will have to have a similar makefile.  The makefile
      is used by typing commands like
      <blockquote><code>
        make ex1
      </code></blockquote>

      the executable <i>ex1</i>, which may then be run by submitting a
