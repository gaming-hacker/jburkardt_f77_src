    <p>
      <b>BROWNIAN_MOTION_SIMULATION</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      simulates Brownian motion in an M-dimensional region,
      creating graphics files for processing by gnuplot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Brownian motion is a physical phenomenon which can be observed, for
      instance, when a small particle is immersed in a liquid.  The particle
      will move as though under the influence of random forces of varying
      direction and magnitude.  
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a mathematical idealization of this motion, and from there a computational
      discretization that allows us to simulate the successive positions of
      a particle undergoing Brownian motion.
