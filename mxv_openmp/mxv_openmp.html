    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MXV_OPENMP</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 program which 
      sets up several matrix vector multiplication problems y=A*x,
      and carries them out using 
      <ul>
        <li>
          "plain vanilla" FORTRAN;
        </li>
        <li>
          "plain vanilla" FORTRAN plus OpenMP parallelization;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The calculations are carried out for a variety of matrix shapes and
      sizes, and the elapsed wall clock time is measured and reported.
      The results are up to the user to analyze and explain!
    </p>

    </h3>

    <p>
      In the BASH shell, the program could be run with 2 threads using the commands:
