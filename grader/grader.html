    <p>
      <b>GRADER</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      is designed for class room grading.  The program stores student records,
      updates them, and produces final grades based on weights.
    </p>

    <p>
      A spreadsheet program is surely a more sensible choice.  At the time,
      however, GRADER was an enjoyable program to write, and found some small
      use locally.
    </p>

    <p>
      GRADER is intended to be useful for an instructor who keeps a 'running'
      grade sheet for a class.  Several tests are given, with grades being
      entered after each test.  Grades may be modified, and students may drop
      out.  At any time, the class and individual averages may need to be
      produced.  For large classes, there may be a subdivision into sections.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the first use of GRADER for a particular class, GRADER will construct
      the file from scratch.  You may choose to enter only the class title
      and the names of the students, or you may also include whatever grade
      information you already have.  When starting up a grade file, you also
      must specify whether Social Security Numbers (SSN) or any alphanumeric
      student identifying code, are to be recorded for each student.  Further,
      you give this file a name.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thereafter, any time that you wish to modify the file, you must run
      GRADER, and specify the file name you gave earlier.  GRADER will then
      offer you a menu of actions, including modification of names or results
      entered earlier, output of all information, or of a class roster or
      of the current grades and averages, or the entry of new information
      for a particular test.
    </p>

    <p>
      GRADER tries to be very careful with what it assumes is sensitive
      information.  Before it works on a file, it sets aside a backup copy.
      Before each operation, it makes a temporary backup copy.  Therefore,
      if you accidentally delete a student from the file, you can recover
      that information if you immediately stop the program, type out the
      temporary file (GRADER.OLD) to make sure it's right, delete the
      damaged file and rename GRADER.OLD to the old file name.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, the damage was done several steps ago during the current
      run.  In that case, you can go back to the backup copy (GRADER.SAV)
      made before the file was touched.  You have then lost only the work
      you did during the current session.
    </p>

    <p>
      GRADER can handle several files during one run.  
      It can sort a file based on the student names or grades.
