cc R4_PROPS calculates mass properties of a general 3D solid.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    This routine calculates mass properties of a general 3D solid using 
c    four point Gaussian quadrature over triangles.
c
c    The routine calculates the contribution of each surface to the mass
c    property integrals.  Integration is performed in subroutine SRFINT.  
c    Mass property calculations are then completed in PROPS.  Data is 
c    assumed to have been previously set up in storage by a data entry routine.
c
c    Surfaces are processed one at a time and the mass property calculations 
c    are accumulated during the processing.  Surface processing involves 
c    starting with the initial face, and proceeding through the secondary 
c    faces, if any.  Surface area vector components are summed for each face
c    of the surface.  The area vector, whose magnitude is the area of the 
c    surface, is then computed from the components and is accumulated in 
c    the total surface area of the solid.
c
c    In the face processing, faces are divided into all unique triangles 
c    having as vertices the the first one of the list and any other two 
c    adjacent vertices of the face polygon.  Four-point Gaussian quadrature 
c    is applied to each triangle, and the results are accumulated in the
c    total mass properties.  Thus each triangle of each face of each surface 
c    has a contribution in the final results.

c
c  Parameters:
c
c    Input, integer KV(*), the face list array.
c
c    Input, integer KFA(MAXS), contains pointers to the initial face
c    list in KV for each surface, ordered by surface number.
c    If L1, L2, and L3 are the locations in KV of face lists for 
c    surfaces 1, 2, 3, then the program would set
c      KFA(1) = L1
c      KFA(2) = L2
c      KFA(3) = L3
c    A pointer value of zero (KFA(I) = 0) indicates that surface I
c    was not utilized in defining the solid.  Hence gaps may
c    occur in the surface numbers.  Also, the order of data
c    entry of the face lists can be entirely arbitrary,
c    because of the afore-mentioned linkage mechanism.
c
c    Output, real AX(MAXS), AY(MAXS), AZ(MAXS), the components of
c    the surface area vector for each surface.
c
c    Input, real VX(MAXV), VY(MAXV), VZ(MAXV), the vertex coordinates.
c
c  Common Parameters:
c

c
c  Local Parameters:
c

c solid polyhedron measures
c -------------------------
c
c solid
c   defined by a set of surfaces, where each surface is
c   composed of one or more coplanar closed polygonal
c   patches called faces.  disconnected faces and faces with
c   one or more holes in them may be used, if necessary,
c   to represent the solid.
c
c face
c   a face is represented by the set of vertex points of the
c   polygonal surface patch, ordered by starting with an
c   arbitrary vertex, and proceeding point by point around
c   the boundary until the first point is reached.
c
c face list
c   the list of the set of vertex numbers, ordered as above
c   for a face, is called a face list, which is the data
c   representation of a face.  a face list has the form
c        nsf,na,nb,nc,...,ni,...,na
c   where nsf is the surface number and na,nb,nc,ni are
c   vertex numbers.  note that the face list is a closed
c   list, starting and ending with the first point selected.
c   for any surface with one or more holes in
c   it, any interior boundary (hole) is represented by a
c   face list with vertices enumerated in a sequence
c   opposite to that given for an exterior boundary.
c
c initial, secondary face lists
c   when multiple face lists are needed to define a surface,
c   (ie, a surface with a hole or one with disconnected but
c   coplanar parts), the first list to appear in the data is
c   called the initial face list, and any other is called a
c   secondary face list.  these lists will have a common
c   surface number and will be linked together in storage by
c   the data entry routine.
c
c global data arrays
c
c linkage to secondary face lists
c   a face list in the array kv has the form
c        nsf,lsi,na,nb,nc,...,ni,nj,nk,...,na
c   where nsf ic the surface number, na,nb,... are vertex
c   numbers, and lsi is a link to a secondary face list.
c   lsi = 0 indicates this is the last face list for a surface.
c   note, it may be the only list.
