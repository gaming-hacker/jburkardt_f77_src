    <p>
      <b>MD_OPENMP</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      carries out a molecular dynamics simulation,
      using OpenMP for parallel execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      On an Apple PowerPC G5 with two processors, the following results were
      observed for 400 steps with 1000 particles:
