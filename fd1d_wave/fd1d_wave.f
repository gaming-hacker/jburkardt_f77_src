c*********************************************************************72
c
cc FD1D_WAVE_ALPHA computes ALPHA for the 1D wave equation.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    The explicit timestepping procedure uses the quantity ALPHA, which
c    is determined by this function.
c
c    If the spatial region bounds are X1 <= X <= X2, containing X_NUM equally
c    spaced nodes, including the endpoints, and the time domain similarly
c    extends from T1 <= T <= T2 containing T_NUM equally spaced time values,
c    then
c
c      ALPHA = C * DT / DX
c            = C * ( ( T2 - T1 ) / ( T_NUM - 1 ) )
c                / ( ( X2 - X1 ) / ( X_NUM - 1 ) ).
c
c    For a stable computation, it must be the case that ALPHA < 1.
c
c    If ALPHA is greater than 1, then the middle coefficient 1-C^2 DT^2 / DX^2 
c    is negative, and the sum of the magnitudes of the three coefficients 
c    becomes unbounded.  In such a case, the user must reduce the time step 
c    size appropriately.

c*********************************************************************72
c
cc FD1D_WAVE_START takes the first step for the wave equation.
c
c  Discussion:
c
c    This program solves the 1D wave equation of the form:
c
c      Utt = c^2 Uxx
c
c    over the spatial interval [X1,X2] and time interval [T1,T2],
c    with initial conditions:
c
c      U(T1,X)  = U_T1(X),
c      Ut(T1,X) = UT_T1(X),
c
c    and boundary conditions of Dirichlet type:
c
c      U(T,X1) = U_X1(T),
c      U(T,X2) = U_X2(T).
c
c    The value C represents the propagation speed of waves.
c
c    The program uses the finite difference method, and marches
c    forward in time, solving for all the values of U at the next
c    time step by using the values known at the previous two time steps.
c
c    Central differences may be used to approximate both the time
c    and space derivatives in the original differential equation.
c
c    Thus, assuming we have available the approximated values of U
c    at the current and previous times, we may write a discretized
c    version of the wave equation as follows:
c
c      Uxx(T,X) = ( U(T,   X+dX) - 2 U(T,X) + U(T,   X-dX) ) / dX^2
c      Utt(T,X) = ( U(T+dt,X   ) - 2 U(T,X) + U(T-dt,X   ) ) / dT^2
c
c    If we multiply the first term by C^2 and solve for the single
c    unknown value U(T+dt,X), we have:
c
c      U(T+dT,X) =        (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X+dX)
c                  +  2 * ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X   )
c                  +      (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X-dX)
c                  -                                  U(T-dT,X   )
c
c    (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT, except for FIRST step!)
c
c    However, on the very first step, we only have the values of U
c    for the initial time, but not for the previous time step.
c    In that case, we use the initial condition information for dUdT
c    which can be approximated by a central difference that involves
c    U(T+dT,X) and U(T-dT,X):
c
c      dU/dT(T,X) = ( U(T+dT,X) - U(T-dT,X) ) / ( 2 * dT )
c
c    and so we can estimate U(T-dT,X) as
c
c      U(T-dT,X) = U(T+dT,X) - 2 * dT * dU/dT(T,X)
c
c    If we replace the "missing" value of U(T-dT,X) by the known values
c    on the right hand side, we now have U(T+dT,X) on both sides of the
c    equation, so we have to rearrange to get the formula we use
c    for just the first time step:
c
c      U(T+dT,X) =   1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X+dX)
c                  +       ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X   )
c                  + 1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X-dX)
c                  +  dT *                         dU/dT(T,   X   )
c
c    (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT for FIRST step.)
c
c    It should be clear now that the quantity ALPHA = C * DT / DX will affect
c    the stability of the calculation.  If it is greater than 1, then
c    the middle coefficient 1-C^2 DT^2 / DX^2 is negative, and the
c    sum of the magnitudes of the three coefficients becomes unbounded.

c  Discussion:

c    A "free" FORTRAN unit number is a value between 1 and 99 which

c    number is needed in order to open a file with the OPEN command.
c
c    If IUNIT = 0, then no free FORTRAN unit could be found, although
c    all 99 units were checked (except for units 5, 6 and 9, which
c    are commonly reserved for console I/O).
c
c    Otherwise, IUNIT is a value between 1 and 99, representing a
c    free FORTRAN unit.  Note that GET_UNIT assumes that units 5 and 6
c    are special, and will never return those values.
