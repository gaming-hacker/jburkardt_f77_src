      TXT_TO_DAT <br> Copy data from text to binary file.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TXT_TO_DAT</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 program which 
      demonstrates how to copy data from a text file to a binary file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program, as written, assumes that the input file is a list of
      (single precision) real numbers, one per line.  The program is easily
      modified to handle other situations.
