     NOTE:
    ======
     This version of the "CONVERT" Program was designed
     to incorporate all FONTS into one DIRECT ACCESS File.
     Whenever the file is written, ALL fonts have to be
     re-defined so that the first record of the file can
     be updated to reflect an accurate record of where each
     subsequent font definition starts.
