    <p>
      <b>scotch_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN77 program which
      tests the scotch sparse matrix package.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scotch package is written in C, and may be compiled to use 32 or 64 bit
      integers, and the FORTRAN77 example needs to locate the correct "include" file
      before compilation, all of which means that getting the FORTRAN77 program 
      to compile, let alone run, is a chancy business.
