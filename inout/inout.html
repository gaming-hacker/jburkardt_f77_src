      INOUT <br> Navier Stokes solutions in the INOUT region.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>INOUT</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 program which
      solves the time-dependent Navier Stokes equations
      in the "INOUT" region,
      by Hyung-Chun Lee.
    </p>

    <p>
      As time increases, other flow parameters may be varied as well.
      For this code, the flow parameter that can vary is the magnitude
      of the inflow specified at the left boundary.
      The program stores the results of each timestep in a file.
      Each solution may be thought of as a "snapshot" of the gradual
      evolution of the flow field over time.
      In a typical run, 500 such files might be created.
    </p>

    <p>
      A collection of snapshot files may be analyzed to seek a small
      underlying basis of fundamental flows.  This basis may be used
      to approximate the entire set, or indeed to generate a reduced basis
      program that can quickly and cheaply compute new flow solutions
      whose flow parameters vary in small ways from those of the original
      set.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "INOUT" region is contained in the unit square, [0,1] x [0,1].
      There is an inlet on the left side, from [0,0] to [0,0.2], and an
      outlet on the right side, from [1,0.8] to [1.0,1.0].

      There are 1,681 nodes in a 41 by 41 evenly spaced grid.  The nodes
      are organized into 800 6-node triangular elements
      which are quadratic in velocity and linear in pressure.

      <b>RUN1</b> is a run of the program used to generated "snapshots", which
      are flow solutions at equally spaced time intervals.  The program
      expects an input file, containing coefficients that define the
      solution at the initial time.  During this run, the boundary conditions
      are varied in a way that is intended to make the system exhibit
      many varied behaviors.  (Right now, to change the boundary conditions
      requires altering the source code of the program.)
