      SPHERE_GRID <br> Grids on a Sphere
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_GRID</b> 
      is a FORTRAN77 library which 
      constructs a grid of points 
      over the surface of the unit sphere in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      A grid on a sphere may mean a set of points, or a set of points and
      lines that connect them, or a set of points, lines that connect them,
      and the faces that are bounded by those lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      A grid may be desired which simply organizes areas.  In that case,
      something like the latitude and longitude lines on a globe may be
      sufficient, even though "evenly spaced" latitude and longitude
      lines result in grid cells that are close to rectangular near
      the equator, but become more asymmetric near the poles.
    </p>

    <p>
      A grid may also be desired for sampling, that is, for choosing
      a set of points that are well spread across the sphere.  A simple
      Monte Carlo approach can be used, although this means that the
      data is only well spread out in the long view; there may be local 
      clusters and gaps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other grids are generated by drawing a spiral on the surface of the
      sphere, and choosing points at regular spacings along that line, or
      by projecting an icosahedron onto the surface of the sphere, which
      divides the surface into 20 congruent spherical triangles, and then
      dealing with the simpler issue of choosing points from the triangles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The test program uses GNUPLOT to make images of some of the grids.
